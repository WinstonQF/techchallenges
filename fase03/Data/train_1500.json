{"title": "France: The Beautiful Cookbook- Authentic Recipes from the Regions of France", "content": " Though at first glance too luscious for the pots, pans and grease stains of the kitchen, this opulently illustrated oversize volume--travel book as much as recipe collection--can function there admirably, seducing the hungry and the restless. The latest in the publisher's series of regional cookbooks (others on Italy, China and Asia have preceded it), it will keep readers turning pages even if they never pick up a saucepan. Chapters alternate between discussing the different regions of France and offering a good selection of traditional recipes. French-born authors and cooks Marianne Comolli, Elisabeth Scotto and Michele Carles reflect on the history and geography of France with appetizers from Provence, entrees from Lyonnais and desserts from Anjou. This is hearty, not haute , cuisine: well-organized recipes are scaled for the average cook, who won't have to go in search of rare ingredients or spend hours chopping and mincing. Les soeurs Scotto make use of blenders and food processors when needed.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "A Day in the Life of China", "content": " Ninety photographers (60 Western, 30 Chinese) fanned out across China on a single day--April 15, 1989--to take the pictures that make up this rare, candid glimpse of the world's most populous nation. The photos show us villages and farms and take us into homes, schools and factories. From a kaleidoscope of images--rice-planting brigades, a defendant in the dock on trial for murder, yaks on Main Street in one city--we get a feel for the contradictions and pressures of a modernizing society. Many of the photos are exceptionally beautiful; taken together, they reveal the diversity of this vast country, moving from the tent-like yurts of Mongolian nomads to a Tantric Buddhist monastery in occupied Tibet. The photo-essay concludes with a glimpse of protest posters that went up at Beijing University as students began to occupy Tiananmen Square, a tragically ironic conclusion in light of events that followed.

{"title": "City of Djinns: A Year in Delhi", "content": " Delhi has a richly layered past, and Dalrymple (In Xanadu, McKay, 1990) deftly peels away each layer to reveal how the city came to be what it is today. Djinns are spirits said to be seen only after prolonged fasting and prayer; they too are integral to understanding the city. The author, a young Scot carrying on the fine British tradition of travel writing, has a knack for meeting fascinating people and capturing their most revealing remarks. He introduces us to dervishes, eunuchs, partridge fighting, weddings, and expatriates. His wife contributes sketches that nicely complement his text. Considering the importance of Delhi, the capital of the world's second most populous nation, this book deserves to be in most public and academic libraries.Harold M.

{"title": "Tuscany: The Beautiful Cookbook", "content": " Illustrated with a fantastic array of culinary and scenic images, this latest entry in HarperCollins's \"beautiful cookbook\" series will find a place both on the coffee table and in the kitchen. Chef and cooking instructor De'Medici ( Italy the Beautiful Cookbook ) here focuses on the relatively small region of Tuscany, where a splendid--and vast--tradition in cookery has flourished for centuries, based, she writes, on a simple \"love of wine, freshly pressed olives and bread.\" Well organized by menu course, the cuisine represented here is rich in fragrant soups fortified with crusty country breads and polentas made with chestnut or garbanzo flours. Some of the most interesting recipes include fresh tuna with peas, stuffed zucchini flowers and a squid and beans dish.

{"title": "The Long Kill", "content": " Eminent British author Reginald Hill, writing as Patrick Ruell, tells a feverishly suspenseful story here. A political assassin identified only by the terse surname Jaysmith, is sent to England's Lake District, where he misses his target, Steven Bryant. Since his forte, \"the long kill\" with the aid of a telescopic lens, is becoming impossible due to his failing eyesight, he phones in his resignation to the man he knows as Jacob in London. Later, the ex-gunman buys a cottage and meets a young widow, Anya Wilson, her small son and her father, whom Jaysmith recognizes as Bryant. The future seems bright for Jaysmith as he and Anya plan marriage, but Jacob suddenly materializes with armed hirelings to dispose of Steven and Anya. Alerted to a conspiracy, Jaysmith braves overwhelming odds in the shoot-out that caps the novel's shocking disclosure.

{"title": "What Shall I Paint? : How to Find the Right Subject in Watercolor, Oils and Acrylics", "content": " The beginning artist usually focuses on how to paint rather than  on what to paint, often to the detriment of the work. A painter  and author with two television series to her credit, Soan  emphasizes the art of seeing as the necessary foundation for all  good painting. Her book helps develop both observational skills  and a deep awareness of the elements that make up a good  picture. She begins with subjects found at home, about town, and  out in the country and proceeds to the sea and exotic locations  further afield. She relates what one sees and one's thoughts and  feelings to the creative image and explores the choice of medium  as an important decision in getting there. This is a fine choice  for amateurs and can be followed by Carole Katchen's more  advanced 200 Great Painting Ideas for Artists.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "William Pitt the Younger: A Biography", "content": " Late-eighteenth-century politician William Pitt the Younger was the youngest (at 24) and longest-serving British prime minister. Beyond those facts, historical opinion varies--some scholars regard him as a reformer, and others as a reactionary, a debate that inspirits Michael Turner'sPittthe Younger (2003). Hague's biography differs from Turner's by muting interpretive issues and amplifying the day-to-day events in a life permeated by politics. Pitt's personal life remains enigmatic, and Hague acknowledges Pitt's elusiveness even as he attempts to ascertain whether he was an alcoholic or a homosexual. More certain is Pitt's ability as a leader and orator of the House of Commons, an institution the author himself knows well; he was the Conservative Party's former debating antagonist of Labour leader Tony Blair. Hague's experience adds convincing power to his account of Pitt's career, explaining how he remained ascendant for so long. A thorough biography, Hague's work is also an able contribution to British parliamentary history.Gilbert TaylorCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

{"title": "Round Ireland in Low Gear", "content": " Touring Ireland by bicycle in the winter is a daunting prospect even for the most seasoned backpackers, but Newby and his wife Wanda weathered it with good humor and resilience. The author of such classics of travel literature as A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush and Slowly Down the Ganges takes the armchair traveler with him as he and his companion contend with misleading signposts, lonely roads, torrential rain, gale-force winds and unhelpful natives who describe any destination as \"up the road a bit\" although it may be circular miles away. As a result, the Newbys fall upon many culturally significant points by absolute chance. Trips to remote castles, holy wells and splendid ruins in the west of Ireland are enlivened by lashings of Guinness and tea, and by the often antic behavior of the locals met in omnipresent pubs. The Newbys, who live in England, returned to Ireland in the summer, when travelers are more expansively welcomed and more places are open, but it is their winter tour that captures the essence of the country and its delightfully idiosyncratic populace.

{"title": "The Complete Short Stories Of Thomas Wolfe", "content": " Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of Wolfe's death and a suitable occasion for a retrospective. Of the 58 stories in this volume, 35 have never before been collected, and one, \"The Spanish Letter,\" is published for the first time. Wolfe was not a short story writer; most of these fragments were plucked from his massive manuscripts, and many would be more appropriately classified as essay or memoir. \"The Spanish Letter,\" relating the author's visits to Nazi Germany, strongly condemns the \"poisoning\" of German culture and society by Hitler and his followers. It's a fine piece, but elsewhere Wolfe's well-known faults are conspicuously displayed. Even one of the best known of these stories, \"Only the Dead Know Brooklyn,\" now embarrasses with its inept attempt to reproduce a Brooklyn accent. The puerile \"Portrait of a Literary Critic\" and heavy-handed \"Justice Is Blind\" are equally disappointing. With all its flaws, this collection serves as a useful reminder of Wolfe's once-formidable presence and the wide influence he formerly exerted.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Simpson, a freelance journalist, reveals that many covert operations of the early Cold War era involved the use of operatives known to have committed crimes against humanity during the Second World War. The underlying theme here is the corruption of American ideals in connection with this hushed-up recruitment policy in the name of anticommunism.

But when TV stations all over the world begin to broadcast the Trippy Show, the fanscalled Trippiesare hypnotized and flock to Trippy communes. By the time the second Tripod invasion begins, the Trippies greet the aliens as saviors and eagerly don the brainwashing caps provided them.

{"title": "A Guidebook to Learning: For a Lifelong Pursuit of Wisdom", "content": " Adler passionately believes that most people, even those with college degrees, have not really acquired the skills necessary to explore the world of ideas. To document his argument that people are not systematically educated and that overspecialization is rampant, the author (Ten Philosophical Mistakes takes us on an A-to-Z romp through encyclopedias, card catalogues and university curricula. Such thinkers as Aristotle, Bacon, Coleridge and Spencer have wrestled with the problem of how to organize all human knowledge. The core of this challenging, if peculiar, \"guidebook\" surveys some 20 thinkers in two- to four-page sections. Adler attempts to provide tools to make the leap from information to organized knowledge and wisdom. His proposal to map current disciplines includes an \"outline of knowledge\" that helped revolutionize the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and an \"index of great ideas\" embodied in the Great Books of the Western World series. Philosophy is restored as queen of the sciences in Adler's scheme, and poetry turns out to be philosophy's handmaiden.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "The FOUR DIMENSIONS OF PHILOSOPHY", "content": " Adler's central thesis, in this concise, lucid survey, is that philosophy not only ranks on a par with science as a means to knowledge, but also claims superiority over science in certain areas, for example, in telling us what ends we ought to pursue. The prolific author of Six Great Ideas equips the armchair thinker with a road map to Western philosophy's peaks, abysses and abiding questions as he underscores the pitfalls to be avoided, and fruits to be won, in pursuing four distinct philosophical realms--metaphysical, moral, objective (i.e., understanding of ideas) and categorical (understanding of subjects). Adler's approach ranges widely, moving from \"disorders\" of medieval thought to the modern \"political illnesses\" of nationalism, tribalism and xenophobia. This invigorating introduction to how philosophy works emphasizes the importance of philosophical introspection in the lives of ordinary men and women.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Definitely not, argue the authors, both professors of archeology and history in Israel. Drawing on 40 years of their own research and synthesizing information from a century of archaeological digs, the Dothans reconstruct the complex material culture of the Philistines, a seafaring people who settled on the coastal plain of Palestine after being defeated by the Egyptians around 1200 B.C., and who subsequently fought violently with the Israelites. As revealed in more than 100 drawings and photographs, the Philistines were accomplished architects, sophisticated urban planners, highly artistic potters, weavers and ivory and metalworkers. A civilizing force, they sat before Aegean-style hearths, practiced elaborate religious rituals and cremated their dead. This intricate account moves the Philistines from the mists of myth onto the stage of history.

The drama of the triocollege students Michael Schwerner and Andy Goodman, both white Northerners, and James Chaney, a young black activist from Mississippipits their faith in nonviolence against a murderous rage fueled by racism.

Huge surpluses from lapsed policies, investments and favorable mortality experience, argues the author, finance exorbitant executive salaries and agent compensation. He sees deception everywhere in the modern insurance world of policies combining mortality charges with a savings/investment program.

TV reporter Harris (Dying to Get Married) relates the tragic story of 16-year-old Tina Isa, murdered in Missouri in 1989 by her father, Zein al-Abdeen Hassan Isa, with her mother's help. The father, from a backwater Palestinian town on the West Bank, was a suspected member of the terrorist Abu Nidal organization, and his home in St. Louis had been bugged by federal agents. Thus the murder was taped, and the parents received death sentences. The proximate cause of the slaying was Tina's attempted assimilation into American culture?her wanting to become independent, to get a job, to date an African American teenager?but the root causes, according to the author, lay in the misogyny of Islam and in the clannish nature of rural Palestinian society, where the \"honor\" of the family is more important than life itself.

His account of what amounted to a living nightmare vividly conveys the extent of organized savagery that held sway in Cambodia from 1975 until the invasion by the North Vietnamese. Some of the details are so ugly that in three places the author suggests that \"readers with sensitive feelings\" skip the balance of a chapter. This is more than a recounting of his ordeal, however; Ngor goes a long way toward explaining why a land known for its shy and gentle people became the site of mass killings that reached genocidal proportions. He also provides an excellent account of the origins of the Khmer Rouge and the career of Pol Pot.

Unable to adjust to life in the South, Frazier went to New York City at age 15 and then to Philadelphia, where eventually a syndicate of businessmen backed him in the ring. He won an Olympic gold medal in 1964 and, after Muhammad Ali was stripped of his title as heavyweight champion for refusing military induction during the Vietnam War, Frazier was named champion in 1970. The following year, he defeated the reinstated Ali and reigned until 1973, when he lost his title to George Foreman. Once a friend of Ali, he became an enemy after a steady barrage of insults from \"The Louisville Lip,\" and it's noteworthy that he always refers to Ali in these pages as Cassius Clay (his pre-Muslim name).

{"title": "Yellow Ribbon: The Secret Journal of Bruce Laingen", "content": " On Nov. 4, 1979, Iranian revolutionaries took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran, and the 444-day ordeal of 52 American hostages began. Laingen, the embassy's charge d'affaires, was held separately with two staffers until three weeks before the general release. Based on his journal and letters to his family, this book offers a somewhat generalized account of his struggle against anger, frustration and boredom. His captivity was relatively uneventful, and much of the material here concerns his reaction to news, such as the failure of the Desert One rescue mission and Ramsey Clark's visit to Tehran for the \"Crimes of America\" conference. Laingen provides a stirring account of the hours leading up to the release of the hostages, their flight to freedom, their meetings with outgoing President Carter and later with newly inaugurated President Reagan. The predictability of the author's views and the absence of other characters in the journal make it of limited appeal for the general reader. Photos.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Unfaithful Angels: How Social Work Has Abandoned its Mission", "content": " The authors here contend that social workers in this country have largely abandoned the tenets of Jane Addams and Mary Richmond, early advocates of societal improvement through nurturance of community life and social case work. The majority of social workers today are trained to help build the individual's sense of self-esteem, using a psychotherapeutic approach with a primarily middle-class clientele and neglecting the underclass , the social dimension, and the potential for using community capacity to help sustain its members. The authors recommend public policy and fiscal support at federal, state, and county levels to redirect the social work profession toward a community-oriented social care system with the goal of a healthier society for all. The arguments and proposals of these two educators in the field will be of much interest to academics, professionals, and many general readers.- Suzanne W.

Her book is the culmination of six years devoted to in-depth interviewing of 250 brutalized wives, including 42 whose despair drove them to kill their husbands. The author's professional objectivity does not lessen the dramatic impact of the many accounts she includes of women repeatedly beaten by their spouses. More than 1.5 million women seek medical treatment each year because of assault by a male partner, but the few who kill to escape this torture are judged harshly and sentenced to prison. This is an important book that should force public action to help victims and victimizersboth of whom are equally unable to help themselves.

Closely scrutinizing personal histories, Colby (coauthor of The Measurement of Moral Justice ) and Damon ( The Moral Child ) delve deeply into the autobiographical origins of their subjects' contributions to civil welfare, social justice, the fight against poverty and a host of other causes. In highlighting the lives of five exemplars with widely differing educational, social and ethnic backgrounds (including former Haverford College president Jack Coleman, noted for his \"blue-collar sabbaticals\"), the authors demystify heroism, stressing the ordinariness of moral commitment as it is played out in everyday social life. Their research points up how role models inspired these people toward a sense of mission, and offers new insights about how moral leadership comes about.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

He urges that prisons be ruled as constitutional governments, with prison authorities who are strong enough to control inmates but compassionate enough to gain respect.

{"title": "We Must Take Charge!", "content": " Finn, noted educator and director, Educational Excellence Network, expounds his sometimes unpopular stance on the state of education in the United States. He characterizes \"the excellence movement of the 1980's . . . as the education system playing at reforming itself . . . designed to restructure without fundamentally altering the system of power relations.\" Finn believes that true educational reform begins with the consumers and not the lawmakers. He contends that reform must be approached on four fronts: 1) school organization, 2) belief that a good education is a vital cultural value, 3) higher education and employers' standards for students and employees, and 4) families supporting positive attitudes toward school.

{"title": "Informing Statecraft: Intelligence for a New Century", "content": " The fruit of many years' experience of intelligence service, this is a masterful exploration of the field, its critical role in statecraft and the principles underlying its use and misuse. Codevilla, senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution, argues that the American apparatus for collecting information, countering hostile intelligence, analyzing information and conducting covert operations developed in a random fashion without reference to underlying precepts. He contends that with notable exceptions U.S. intelligence has \"usually failed,\" and he expresses astonishment at how unreflective those in charge of policy have been. In this closely reasoned, authoritative study, Codevilla conveys skepticism about the usefulness of spies, the efficacy of the CIA and the value of secret operations: \"American covert action has made little difference in the world.\"Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Armchair Economist: Economics &amp; Everyday Life", "content": " Landsburg demystifies the economics of everyday behavior in these diverting if not always persuasive essays. Why don't promoters of sell-out rock concerts raise the advance ticket price? Because, suggests the author, promoters want the good will of teenage audiences who will buy lots of rock paraphernalia. Why are executives' salaries so high? One reason, opines Landsburg, is that stockholders expect managers to take risks, and well-heeled executives are more likely to do so. Associate professor of economics at the University of Rochester in New York, Landsburg applies his counter-intuitive analyses, with mixed results, to everything from taxes, auctions, baseball and the high price of movie theater popcorn to government inefficiency, the death penalty, environmentalism (which he attacks as a dogmatic, coercive ideology) and NAFTA.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

{"title": "Domestic Revolutions: A Social History Of American Family Life", "content": " American family structure has changed radically in the 300 years since patriarchal Puritan days, when it was the basic political, religious and educational unit of state and community, maintain Mintz, University of Houston associate professor of history, and Kellogg, his wife, who teaches anthropology, also at Houston. The authors vividly evoke a diversity of family patterns and experiences among racial and ethnic groups, including Afro-American slave kinship networks. They discuss how changes wrought in working-class families by the agricultural and industrial revolutions, the Great Depression and WW II affected family roles and relationships. Emerging from the relative stability of the 1950s and the largely mythical ideal of the nuclear family, today's aging, individual-oriented society, transformed by a sexual revolution, considers the family in whatever formcohabitation, single-parent households, \"blended\" families from several marriages, among othersas a means of personal fulfillment for both partners, with public institutions taking over many of its traditional roles.

She notes, \"The longer an illness or incapacity lasts, the harder it becomes for us to maintain faith in our helper's good will,\" adding, \"most people resist dependence and struggle to maintain a secure sense of identity by asking for as little as they can.\" Although the author's observations, as well as those from such diverse sources as Proust biographer George Painter and Arthur Kleinman, author of The Illness Narrative , comprise much of the text, these references interrupt the real story, which is related by patients themselves. From incapacitated men and women we learn of the humiliations caused by the loss of autonomy, of the frustrations at not being able to manage on one's own. Accounts from widely different sorts of patients and those who begrudgingly or willingly see to their care provide graphic lessons in sensitivity.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

The book is extremely well researched, covering all aspects of Hoover's controversial career from the Red Scare following World War I to the 1960s and his personal vendettas against Martin Luther King and the civil rights and antiwar movements. While the discussions of Hoover's private life is rather thin, this is due more to a lack of materials than to any failings in the author's research.

{"title": "Exile's Return: The Making of a Palestinian American", "content": " Born in a town that is now part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Palestinian activist Turki ( Soul in Exile ) fled his homeland with his family in 1949 and grew up in a Beirut refugee camp. This arresting memoir tracks his quest for self-discovery to Australia, where he emigrated in his late teens, and to hippie wanderings in Nepal, India and Europe. In the mid-1970s, he moved to the U.S. with the \"nice Jewish girl\" whom he married and soon divorced; he chronicles his years of self-destructive drinking, drug-taking and womanizing, and his later, mature emergence as a Palestinian-American leader. Turki recounts his return to his birthplace on the eve of the Persian Gulf War in 1990-1991. Repelled by what he sees as Palestinian society's repressive patriarchy, Turki denounces the PLO as blatantly corrupt and incompetent. He sharply criticizes the Arab world's authoritarian regimes, terrorism and religious fundamentalism.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

{"title": "Defying the Crowd: Cultivating Creativity in a Culture of Conformity", "content": " Sternberg (psychology and education, Yale) and Lubart propose that creativity, like intelligence, is something everyone has and that it can be developed. Able to generate/intuit new and possibly unpopular ideas and work with determination to make these ideas accepted by others, creative people, the authors state, have the willingness to take sensible risks to go against the crowd in effective ways. These traits may explain why commercial, educational, and political institutions make great overtures to creativity but are seldom truly able to integrate it. Sternberg (editor of Encyclopedia of Human Intelligence, LJ 1/95, among many others) and Lubart also discuss the difference between creative potential and creative performance. They include individual chapters on the six personal, creative resources: intelligence, knowledge, thinking style, personality, motivation, and the environmental context.

How she and other parents help their foreign-born children ease into American society is examined and evaluated.

Reeves reveals how indifferent Kennedy was to the moral and legal objections to the Bay of Pigs invasion, the overthrow of the Diem regime in South Vietnam, and plans for the assassination of Fidel Castro. There is a wealth of new material here concerning JFK's often precarious health, his relationship with his wife, his flagrant philandering. Reeves concludes that Kennedy abused his high position for personal self-gratification, that his reckless liaisons with women and mobsters were \"irresponsible, dangerous, and demeaning to the office of chief executive.\" By the author of The Life and Times of Joe McCarthy , this is a solidly researched look at John Kennedy's morals or his lack thereof.

Fedders, an official of the Securities Exchange Commission. The couple lived graciously in Washington, where in the privacy of their home the husband beat his wife and browbeat their five sons. In a less melodramatic telling, the book would more forcefully call needed attention to the problem of abused women. It is made abundantly clear that Fedders suffered brutality but the reason why she endured it for so many years is not satisfactorily explained. Elliott's contention that the victim's Catholic upbringing trained her to submissiveness is not entirely convincing. And there is no analysis of why the husband, with the same religious background, became a dangerous bully. Elliott is a reporter for Washingtonian magazine.

Steiner's dubious faith calls for packing manure into cow horns, burying it for a specified period, then digging up the mixture and diluting it to manufacture a spray that apparently eliminates chemical poisons commonly added to the soil. Tompkins and Bird, coauthors of The Secret Life of Plants , cite the work of scientists and philosophers such as Steiner to support their extravagant claims; they report on the special qualities of glacial water and efforts to produce it in the laboratory, and tell of a plant breeder who believes that birdsong, music and a natural foliar fertilizer can stimulate plant growth (\"sonic bloom\").

Beginning in 1905, with Franklin and Eleanor's honeymoon, it covers FDR's years as New York state senator, assistant secretary of the Navy, his early struggle to overcome the ravages of polio and ends with his election as governor of New York in 1928. Ward not only traces the development of Roosevelt's \"first-class temperament\" but provides dimensional characterizations of friends, enemies and family members, gallantly defending FDR's often-maligned mother, Sara, and revealing the effect on the Roosevelt children of the tensions between Franklin and Eleanor. FDR's jaunty, fun-loving nature and his \"breezy duplicity\" are brought into focus in the early sections, but the tone deepens in the moving account of the future president's valiant but hopeless attempt to regain the use of his legs. Going against the accepted legend, Ward maintains that \"the Roosevelt who could not walk was in most respects very like the one who could.\" Photos.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Analyzing Leonardo's notebooks and annotated erotic drawings, as well as contemporary sources, the author depicts the Renaissance prodigy as a man who felt rejected by his father, ambivalent about his homosexuality and both curious about and disgusted by male-female sex. Though vehemently anticlerical, Leonardo believed in God--indeed, was almost jealous of the Creator, whom he called \"inventor of everything.\" Bramly has dusted off the primary sources to make da Vinci a startlingly prescient, relevant figure in this exceptional biography.

The self-righteous book pictures Maheu as victim of a scheme by a \"Mormon Mafia\" of aides to turn Hughes against him. Having lost his wealth and spent years battling indictments for fraud and in unsuccessful libel suits against Hughes, Maheu nevertheless \"cried like a child\" upon learning of the boss's mistreatment by his entourage--resulting, alleges Maheu, in Hughes's death.

{"title": "Jefferson Davis: The Man and His Hour", "content": " This portrait puts the emphasis on Davis's private warmth, public coolness, personal insecurity and indecisiveness during the Civil War. Relying mostly on contemporary sources, the author ( Image of the War ) explores how Davis's attitudes and values were developed at West Point and during his Mexican War service and how they were put to the test in his years as U.S. senator, as secretary of war under Franklin Pierce and as president of the Southern Confederacy. The author defends Davis (1808-1889) against the charge that he interfered with his generals, partly by showing how well he and Robert E. Lee worked together. The book also makes clear that Davis lacked managerial skill, was inflexible, could not admit making a mistake and had great difficulty delegating authority. Nevertheless, as the author points out, Davis built the systems that kept the Confederacy afloat from his inauguration in 1862 until he was captured by Union troops in 1865. This is a pragmatic but sympathetic biography that explains why Davis was respected but never loved by the citizens of the Confederate states.

{"title": "Step by Step Organic Vegetable Gardening: The Gardening Classic Revised and Updated", "content": " For those who want to learn organic gardening without authorial preaching, Ogden may be the perfect teacher. Building on the knowledge passed on by his grandfather, Samuel Ogden (who wrote the original Step by Step in 1975) and on his own years as a market farmer and seedsman, Ogden leads the reader through the process of becoming a good organic gardener. As he states in the epilogue, the book is meant for people who \"want to garden without danger to themselves and without damage to the environment\"; in his view, they're neither fanatics of technique nor devotees of traditional ritual for its own sake. Chapters cover planning, seed starting, compost-making and planting. Along the way to a large section on individual vegetables, Ogden gives his opinions on a variety of subjects, from pesticides and power tools to chemically treated seed and the wisdom behind crop rotation, always taking the reassuring tone of a very patient elder. His discussion of vegetable growing is filled with recommendations on varieties, as well as tips on planting, cultivating and harvesting.

{"title": "Ol' Diz: A Biography of Dizzy Dean", "content": " It is curious that after decades of neglect, Hall of Fame pitcher Dizzy Dean (1910-1974) should be the subject of two biographies in the same month. Robert Gregory's Diz (Nonfiction Forecasts, Nov. 29), although it does not neglect the colorful side of the athlete and broadcaster, takes a more conventional approach, while the book in hand is anecdotal. Staten ( Unauthorized America ) tries to identify the apocryphal stories, many the result of sportswriters' imaginations, but he relates them nevertheless. The result is a singularly readable account which includes Dizzy's accurate prophetic boast that he and brother Paul would win at least 45 games for the Cardinals in 1934 as well as his response to criticism of his grammar by English teachers: \"Lots of people who ain't sayin' 'ain't' ain't eatin'.\" Never a dull moment.

{"title": "The Language of the Night: Essays on Fantasy and Science Fiction", "content": " For Le Guin, writing science fiction or fantasy is an intuitive, self-exploratory act, an inner-space voyage in which she unearths dreams and archetypes that connect her with the outer world. In these conversational, feisty essays, an energizing mind trip for SF fans, she dissects her own fiction, discusses technique and explores the potential of SF and fantasy, which she considers different branches of the same form of writing. Most SF has been regressive and unimaginative, she argues, by portraying authoritarian dystopias instead of democratic socialist societies. She also berates the genre for its marginalization of women, both as fictional characters and as writers. This is essentially a reissue of a 1979 compilation that went out of print in 1982.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

{"title": "Patsy: The Life and Times of Patsy Cline", "content": " The turbulent life of the country music star whose popularity continues long after her death in 1963 is chronicled in this biography with compelling sympathy and an attention to detail that will appeal to fans. Cline's stuggle to develop a unique country act began in Winchester, Va., in a musical, if dysfunctional, family. According to Jones, a PW contributing editor, \"a home environment charged with guilt, shame and fear\" led by an abusive father had a direct bearing on the marital problems and hard drinking of Cline's adult years. At the time of her death in a car accident at age 30, Cline was a headliner at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, a multimillion-dollar recording star and an influence on a generation of country singers with classics like \"Crazy\" and \"Walking After Midnight.\" This sad story follows the grueling hardships and remarkable triumphs of a legendary country musician.

{"title": "The Things That Matter Most", "content": " A blustery foreword by Rush Limbaugh sets the tone for this collection of articles by syndicated columnist Thomas, who considers liberalism the greatest threat to contemporary America and condemns homosexuals, popular music and the \"cultural, media and academic elites.\" Thomas's rhetoric makes his partisan views sound more populist than political: \"Common sense\" is a litany in these columns, and for Thomas \"a little censorship,\" school prayer and the GOP make sense, while welfare, sex education and abortion do not. Baby boomers come under particular attack for \"their relentless pursuit of social anarchy.\" Thomas shows no patience for those who, in his opinion, use their freedom of expression improperly, among them the ACLU and network television. Thomas's prose is blunt, his arguments visceral rather than reasoned. Accordingly, only on his terms and through his conception of American society might this book be considered anything but dogmatism. 150,000 first printing; $150,000 ad/promo; Conservative Book Club dual main selection; Doubleday Book Club alternate; author tour.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Death Beat: A Colombian Journalist's Life Inside the Cocaine Wars", "content": " A columnist covering the Colombian drug beat for Bogata-based El Espectador , Duzan endured the jungle to interview guerrillas, found her apartment bombed by drug lords, saw her newspaper building bombed and suffered the murder of her documentary filmmaker sister. Nevertheless, she helped to form a remarkable cartel of news organizations to jointly publish non-bylined (and thus safer) investigative reports on the drug organizations, and also uncovered for her paper massacres by militias associated with the government. Less a personal tale than a survey of Colombia's recent past, the book is disorganized at times, offering detailed accounts of Colombian politics. But Duzan's depictions of brave patriots, slum kids-turned-assassins, and a village corrupted by the coca trade make this an important account of the Latin American costs--both economic and human--of the world's drug habit.

Shenkman, coauthor of One Night Stands with American History , begins with our presidents and disabuses readers of the idea that poor boys can grow up to occupy the White House (there have been few). He goes on to a multitude of subjects, including sex, war, the frontier, education, art, pointing out along the way that prostitution flourished in the Victorian era, that the defenders of the Alamo did not all perish in the battle and that in the antebellum South not all whites backed slavery. The book is occasionally eye-opening and always fun.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Her descriptions of techniques are excellent and authoritative but unintimidating. The sections on equipment and ingredients are equally good, and the recipes are wide-ranging and mouthwatering.

Accurate and unpatronizing, Hillerman's works consistently evoke nature and place. This visual equivalent is a collaborative effort between the author and his brother, a professional photographer for 40 years. The text mixes popularized history and anthropology with personal observations and anecdotes. A thoughtful selection of excerpts from Hillerman's novels serve as captions to many of the 200 color photos.

{"title": "Hunting the Devil/Pursuit, Capture and Confession of the Most Savage Serial Killer in History", "content": " This is the story of Andrei Chikatilo, a sadistic sexual serial killer convicted in Rostov of 53 murders of women and children. In the former Soviet Union, information about crime was rarely forthcoming, but now this shocking case has received considerable publicity and spawned several new and forthcoming books (Peter Conradi's The Red Ripper , Dell, 1992; Robert Cullen's The Killer Department , previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 1/93). Lourie, author of Russia Speaks ( LJ 3/15/91), focuses on detective Issa Kostoev, who led the years-long investigation that finally caught Chikatilo (but not before an innocent man was executed for his first murder). Given the subject, this is a rather bland effort, lacking the supporting details and dramatic intensity found in compelling crime writing.

{"title": "Shark Attack: Jerry Tarkanian and His Battle With the Ncaa and Unlv", "content": " Jerry Tarkanian, the head coach of the men's basketball program at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, is one of the most controversial coaches in college basketball. Tarkanian's reputation for giving academically borderline players a second chance (and then winning championships with them) is one reason for his decade long struggle with the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the governing agency for collegiate sports. The NCAA has a history of selective enforcement of their rules and has actively pursued Tarkanian, who is one of their most outspoken critics. While Yaeger is overly supportive of Tarkanian, he makes a strong case for the NCAA having too much unrestrained authority. He also criticizes the NCAA's habit of basing their investigations on hearsay. This interesting if biased look at a controversial coach will circulate in most sports collections.- J.

While these books talk about the magical and shamanistic practices of Don Juan and his lineages, this new book begins with Don Juan chiding Castaneda about his physical well-being (or lack of it) and then teaching Castaneda the physical movements practiced by the sorcerers. These magical movements are called \"tensegrity\"?a combination of the tension of contracting and relaxing with the integrity of the body moving in one complete unit.

Davis (Jefferson Davis: The Man and His Hour) chronicles the development of the Old Southwest (Mississippi and Alabama) from early settlement through the 1830s.

Given the huge gaps in theoretical astronomy that remain, theirs was not an unreasonable approach . In her much longer exegesis, science writer Bartusiak ( Thursday's Universe ) finds no odds-on winner, either. She offers a lively review of astronomers' struggle to find the stuff of the universe since Hubble. Sidelights on the quirks in the personal lives of 19th-century astronomers (the author is more discreet in her profiles of the living) interrupt the time line of the science.

{"title": "Message from Forever: A Novel of Aboriginal Wisdom", "content": " A warmed-over account of an Australian woman's walkabout in search of her aboriginal heritage and the meaning of existence, this latest offering from the author of the bestselling Mutant Message Down Under is more of the same: rage over the aborigines' disenfranchisement, touchy-feely eulogies for their nomadic wisdom and dire predictions of an ecological doomsday for the civilization that did them in. When Beatrice Lake is separated the day after her birth from her teenage aborigine mother and twin brother, she begins a lifelong journey that will take her back to her ancestry and ultimately reunite her with her twin, Geoff, who is serving a life sentence in a Florida prison. After 36 years in the wilderness, Bea decides to return to civilization and repatriate Geoff. Overflowing with intimations of \"Oneness,\" \"Foreverness,\" \"Knowingness\" and such icons as the Rainbow Snake from the mythic Dreamtime, this humdrum little walk on the wild side is unworthy of Morgan's real-life concerns with the plight of the aborigines and the environment.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

His title has deliberate meaning: Boorstin implies the historian's need to probe socio-political patterns from philosophical and uncliched angles. Here he recaptures his \"historical adventures,\" ranging from a study of the historian's discipline (his insight into Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire as an \"intimate\" work is rich and subtle) through a look at America as a \"By-Product Nation\" not greatly driven by theories, but rather formed by action under stress (he sees FDR's four-term presidency as an example). And finally, a series of segments from his writingspresent his views of America's \"unsung\" political experiments.

The gist of it is that when a divorce is not amicable, the woman is usually treated unfairly by the courts. Ironically, some of the legislation passed since 1970 to aid women in divorce cases, such as equitable distribution, community property and mediation laws, has had the opposite effect, because it allows lawyers to rack up hours chasing down assets. Winner considers lawyers a major factor in the many injustices divorcing women suffer, largely because many lawyers, in her view, are interested not in fairness but money.

{"title": "Paradise of the Blind: A Novel", "content": " This staunchly unsentimental, evocative novel, originally published in Huong's native Vietnam and beautifully translated by Duong and McPherson, offers a narrative rich in detail and free of cliche. The author, who lives with her children in Hanoi, depicts the complexity of Vietnamese culture--the allegiance to family and ancestors, the symbolic value of food, class distinctions and the continuing sense of desperation mingled with pride. The protagonist, Hang, a physically fragile young woman of the '80s, recalls Hanoi in the previous decade. While there are subtle allusions to war and peacetime, Huong's focus is on the shifting, uneasy relationships between modernized Hang and her traditionalist mother, a merchant who peddles food; Hang's selfish, hypocritical uncle, a communist peasant; and Hang's comparatively wealthy, unconditionally loving aunt. Contrasts between young, old, urban and rural, help to convey the full variety of Vietnamese lifestyles. McPherson's introduction provides essential background information without spoiling the plot of Huong's unquestionably powerful tale.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

{"title": "Under the Big Top: A Season with the Circus", "content": " After several years of work and travel abroad, Feiler (Learning to Bow) decided that joining the circus would be a good way to study America, as well as live a long-deferred childhood dream. He was accepted as a clown and spent the eight-month 1993 season with the Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros. Circus, which plays the South and Northeast. With performers from more than a dozen countries, this troupe was truly a melting pot, though most had picked up some of the racism they encountered here. Far from conforming to the image of degenerates, the circus people the author met led rather conventional lives within their restricted world. Feiler admits the humor of clowns is \"silly,\" and few readers are likely to share his admiration for acts like that of a young woman who juggles while hanging by her hair. Generally, however, this warm and affectionate memoir is pleasantly entertaining.

{"title": "Third Watch: Acorna's Children", "content": " At the start of this readable light entry in McCaffrey and Scarborough's popular Acorna series (Acorna's Rebels, etc.), Acorna's long-lost daughter, Korii, and Korii's twin, Ariin, travel through time and space in search of the secret of the plague that's endangering galactic civilization. With them is their faithful cat, Khiindi, who turns out to be a good deal more than he seems. After plenty of stirring adventures, the twins find that the secret of the plague lies in the elder race known as the Ancestral Friends, in particular in one not-so-friendly Lord Odus. The time traveling is almost too easy, and the book isn't for newcomers despite the comprehensive glossary and notes, but series fans will appreciate the authors' genuine feeling for their human characters as well as for cats and dragons.(Aug.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Abner &amp; Me (Baseball Card Adventures)", "content": " Gr. 5-8. Joe Stoshack knows that he can travel back in time when he holds the right baseball card. Now he wants to see if Abner Doubleday really invented baseball (he did not, of course), but this time it's a photo of Civil War general Doubleday that sends Stosh and his nurse mom back in history--to the Battle of Gettysburg. Before pulling out a card to get home, Stosh gets to see Union soldiers playing a pickup game, with different rules and antique, but quite recognizable nomenclature. Gutman reports on the battle matter-of-factly, even as the boy's mom saves a life in the hellish hospital quarters after the battle. Her quest to save Lincoln via time travel does not fare so well. Although lightweight for its heavy topic, fans of the Baseball Card Adventure series will still want to read this one.

{"title": "A Share in Death (Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James Novels)", "content": " This polished mystery seems more the work of a seasoned genre master than the first novel it is. Det. Supt. Duncan Kincaid, spending his vacation from Scotland Yard at a Yorkshire time-share along with several other guests, finds his holiday anything but relaxing. Immediately after he arrives at the elegant estate, he overhears a heated argument between the snobbish caretaker and her sarcastic assistant manager. Late that evening, the assistant is electrocuted in the Jacuzzi. To the consternation of Yorkshire police, Kincaid assumes an active role in the investigation, which becomes more urgent after two more deaths. Meanwhile, Sgt. Gemma James, a pragmatic single mother charmed by Kincaid's unpretentious demeanor and bachelor status, digs for additional clues in London. Crombie, a Texan, has written a convincingly British whodunit, limning Kincaid and James with the ease and authority of one who has already completed several installments in a series. Readers will surely welcome follow-up appearances.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"title": "Warning: Psychiatry Can Be Hazardous to Your Mental Health", "content": " Swimming against what he sees as the tide of prescriptions written for antidepressants such as Paxil, Zoloft and Prozac, psychiatrist Glasser (Choice Theory) argues that these drugs can do more harm than good. He asserts that there has been some scientifically sound psychiatric research that suggests the drugs can damage mental health and even the brain itself. Through selective case studies and extrapolation of evidence, the author urges readers to think twice before accepting \"brain drugs\"; he states that the effectiveness of certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has been exaggerated by the drug companies. To his credit, Glasser does offer several practical alternatives for patients. But he seems to cherish his outsider status and questions the way psychiatry is practiced today. Group therapy transcripts and case studies constitute the bulk of his case, and chapters like \"Luck, Intimacy, and Our Quality World\" and \"We Have Learned to Destroy Our Own Happiness\" are designed to help the reader understand symptoms. Some of the anecdotes are compelling, and individuals seeking alternatives to drug treatments may benefit.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

When the cops learn that a murdered man with a sordid personal history has links to one of Arizona's most prominent judges, Joanna's investigation turns up a connection to an early case of her late father's, an honored sheriff. Next, the brutal beating of Jeannine Phillips, an Animal Control officer, leads the sheriff's department, its staff already stretched thin, to a confrontation with a notorious ranching family and suspected illegal immigrants. Then Joanna's obnoxious in-laws arrive for the imminent birth. In a heart-stopping climax, Joanna shoots a suspect as he tries to kidnap two children.

{"title": "Amazing Gorillas! (I Can Read Book 2)", "content": " Grade 1-3&ndash;Using simple sentences, Thomson explains the basic facts of gorilla life, including their behavior, diet, and habitat. The author devotes a lot of space to the similarities shared by these animals and humans, highlighting how gorillas are part of a family, play with their children, and communicate. The last section describes how scientists study these primates and emphasizes the destruction of their habitat and the need to protect them from harm. While the readable text is presented in large print, it is somewhat dense, often filling the pages. Also, some of the full-color photos are not very well reproduced.

Words are defined within the text. For beginning readers, this is much easier than referring to a glossary because it keeps the terms in context and allows the text to flow with minimal interruption. Spectacular color photographs add detail and drama, with some intimate close-ups of the magnificent mammals. The book ends with a few pages about whale conservation and raises questions that suggest the need for further investigation, and may serve as a springboard for rich classroom discussion.

As Margaret and Michael Korda point out, before World War I, practically everyone knew at least the rudiments of horse care, and horses were everywhere. Now most people ride at a stable, and the idea of a backyard horse is an exotic one. For those with the space and the desire to bring their horses home, the Kordas have produced a useful guide to housing backyard horses. Written in an anecdotal style, and full of stories about their own farm, the authors share the triumphs as well as the pitfalls of keeping horses. One of the main things the authors stress is the fact that horse keepers in the long run will not save much money, but will be doing things in the way that they want.

{"title": "Moral Combat: Good and Evil in World War II", "content": " Starred Review. A moral history of WWII would be brief, said one wit, but respected British historian Burleigh (Blood Rage: A Cultural History of Terrorism) delivers a long, riveting account of awful events and the perverted reasoning behind them. Communist, Nazi, Fascist, and Japanese systems claimed to be regimes of public virtue carrying out inexorable historical processes. Proclaiming that the only evil was obstructing this march to utopia, all discarded the rule of law and alternative moral authority (religion, ethics). The Holocaust and other familiar WWII atrocities top off an exhaustive litany of mass murder, brutality, and squalid cruelty perpetrated by governments, military leaders, local officials, and ordinary individuals who, acting without moral values, became monsters. Burleigh does not ignore Hiroshima and Allied mass bombing campaigns, but deplores the current fashion for balancing the moral books. All nations acted shamefully, he concludes, but denies that Eleanor Roosevelt's youthful anti-Semitism made America complicit with Hitler, as one recent revisionist implied. 16 pages of color photos.

{"title": "Katharine Hepburn Once Said...: Great Lines to Live By", "content": " Readers who are unwilling to truck through A.

The author of Touched by a Saint: Personal Encounters with Mother Teresa and The Many Lives of Elton John collects \"Hepburnisms\" on subjects ranging from love and marriage to aging gracefully, packaging them into an attractive bundle of text (printed in large font) and photographs. Upbeat and straightforward, Hepburn has spunky thoughts on women (\"I find a woman's point of view much grander and finer than a man's\"); life (\"If you obey all the rules, you miss all the fun!\"); and her career (\"I don't care how afraid I may be inside-I do what I think I should\").

{"title": "Desert Wisdom: Sacred Middle Eastern Writings from the Goddess Through the Sufis", "content": " This book tries to invent an overarching Middle Eastern spirituality using 3000 years of religious history and a dozen widely disparate cultures-something that cannot be done. There is no more a single coherent spirituality of the Middle East than of the West (which Douglas-Klotz deplores) or of Native Americans (which he applauds). Indeed, beliefs as divergent as those of the Egyptian Middle Kingdom and the Mandeans can only be compared. The author frequently uses \"expanded translation,\" a lengthy commentary in verse, to explicate much shorter selections of ancient poetry. But often these expansions err, e.g., ancient spirituality cannot be understood in terms of modern physics (\"wave and particle\") or New Age thought (\"vibration\"). If Desert Wisdom has little to commend it in theoretical terms, it has less as a work of popular spirituality, offering meditations consisting mainly of mantras, centering methods, guided imaginings, and breathing exercises-useful practices but already more thoroughly treated elsewhere.

{"title": "A Noble Death: Suicide and Martyrdom Among Christians and Jews in Antiquity", "content": " Focusing primarily on the period from the death of Socrates to Augustine of Hippo, the authors investigate the Greek legacy: the six cases of voluntary death in the Hebrew Bible and later references to these; Josephus, Philo, and early Rabbinic ideas; early Christian ideas of martyrdom and the teachings of Greek Fathers of the Church and Tertullian. They emphasize the voluntariness of martyrdom and the great shift in Christian opinion of voluntary death occasioned by Augustine's absolute condemnation of it, except in the express instance of divine command. Droge and Tabor view their study as important background to today's death-with-dignity issues.

{"title": "The Physics of Angels: Exploring the Realm Where Science and Spirit Meet", "content": " Here is another book about heaven's winged creatures. But, what a book this is. Essentially a dialogue between the radical theologian and Episcopalian priest Fox and maverick biologist Sheldrake, this book is a bizarre amalgam of New Age speculation and exploration of the writings of Dionysius the Areopagite, Thomas Aquinas and Hildegard of Bingen for news of angels. Of angel lore there is much of merit in this book, but the book is irritating when it pretends to be science rather than spirituality. The authors' work would have benefited from a heavier editorial hand, for the book often reads like an e-mail exchange in which the effort at dialogue too easily descends into monologue. Fox and Sheldrake have written a book that is charming without being dangerous.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "The Reinvention of Work: New Vision of Livelihood for Our Time, A", "content": " \"To live well is to work well,\" wrote Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century, yet many people are reporting to jobs every day that provide little satisfaction. Fox, a former Catholic priest and widely published author (Creation Spirituality, LJ 5/1/91), asserts that life and livelihood are about spirit. He contrasts the machine era, when the universe was perceived as a machine, with the green (\"sheen\") era, when the universe is seen as a mystery and where God is in all things. Arguing that all work should have dignity, Fox envisions a work world in which intellect, heart, and health harmonize to celebrate the whole person. Though Fox achieves his aims of providing an essay in \"deep ecumenism,\" his philosophy of work seems to have little practical relevance to the work world.

The 2002 revision, by Gaustad (history, emeritus, Univ. of California, Riverside) and Schmidt (religion, Princeton Univ.), retains the core material with a revised chapter structure, updated bibliographies, and some text revisions. In some cases, the revisions are simply rearrangements of chapter sections, while in others there is a shift in terminology e.g., using \"African American\" for \"black\" and replacing \"American religion\" with the more clearly designated \"American Protestantism.\" While such changes are subtle, they do alter the tone of the work, bringing it more in line with current approaches to the study of religion and American culture.

Kidd's successful pilgrimage from her Southern Baptist roots and away from the patriarchal and fundamentalist Christian religious systems surrounding her is an account of anger turned to courage, creativity and love. A mid-career realization that she had lived without \"real inner authority\" and with \"a fear of dissension, confrontation, backlash, a fear of not pleasing, not living up to sanctioned models of femininity\" produced in Kidd the new mindset that made her journey possible. Additionally, her extensive knowledge of many subjects, including theology, mythology and the arts, made possible the copious references and cross-references that will prove invaluable for readers who wish to follow her in this same search. While Kidd cautions that each woman's path will be unique, there is no question but that many women will find in her book a mirror of their own present conditions and a hopeful call to self-discovery.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

The author, a columnist for the Religion News Service, was a lapsed Roman Catholic who tried Hinduism before becoming a charismatic Episcopalian; her husband, Fr. Gregory, pastor of the Holy Cross Mission in Baltimore, is a former Episcopal priest. Homeschoolers who believed the Episcopal Church was \"repealing the creed and condoning immorality,\" the couple has joined a contingent of evangelical Christians who have, in recent years, been converting to Eastern Orthodoxy. Mathewes-Green offers an intimate glimpse of this piece of the contemporary American religious landscape. Writing with charm and humor and a convert's zeal, she weaves reflections on family life, friendship and personal spirituality with descriptions of Orthodox worship and fellowship. However, she glosses over Orthodoxy's theology and ecclesiastical structure, focusing mainly on externals. As a result, lifelong Orthodox may feel this chatty depiction trivializes their faith, while outsiders may be frustrated by the lack of explanatory content.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

{"title": "Our Greatest Gift: A Meditation on Dying and Caring", "content": " Nouwen, well-loved author of such books as The Wounded Healer , offers us here a gentle, almost meditative book on coming to terms with death. Reflecting on his own not-so-distant future death, as well as on the deaths of loved ones and friends, he shares his view of death as a gift, an opportunity to impart hope to those around us, whether through our own dying or in our caretaking of someone else. In embracing death, says Nouwen, one comes to ask: \"How can I so live that I can continue to be fruitful when I am no longer here among my family and friends?\" One can, in other words, make choices that effect not just one's self but also the generations to come--choices to care well, to die well and to embrace Grace. If there is a limitation to this book it lies in its failure to deal explicitly as well as implicitly with sudden and/or violent death.

Spong is careful to acknowledge previous scholars and to distinguish fact or knowledge from speculation. He encourages a midrashish or imaginative approach to the Gospels and points out how literalism of scripture and creed in the Virgin Mary references led to sexism in church teaching.

{"title": "Proof Positive", "content": " In bestseller Margolin's third legal thriller featuring feisty defense lawyer Amanda Jaffe (after 2003'sWild Justice), respected forensic expert Bernard Cashman, who works for the Oregon State Crime Laboratory, has developed a personal philosophy that allows him to manufacture evidence to ensure the successful prosecution of those he feels are guilty, especially if crucial evidence is missing. He's not a madman, just absolutely sure that he knows more than judge, jury and the legal system when it comes to administering justice. After a fellow crime lab employee approaches him about discrepancies in his work, he adds murder to his list of methods that ensure his continuing crusade. Amanda is still working in her father's law firm and still having trouble with her love life, though Margolin wisely steers clear of wasting much time on her personal problems.

This time Patch gets tangled up with eastern European mobsters after four members of his motorcycle club (not, he emphasizes, a gang) are found dead, festooned with counterfeit cash and locked in a meat freezer. Patch is not so much a sympathetic character as he is a lucky bumbler of almost Shakespearean proportions; the double-crosses that mystify him can be seen coming a mile away and it's hard not to laugh at someone who gets himself sent to federal prison on a thousand-to-one shot at getting to a high-profile informant, but you still cheer when he pulls it all off in the end.

The Emperor San and his Circle of Immortals strive to protect the medieval empire of the Fourlands from monstrous creatures called Insects, but the continuity of the Circle is threatened. Serein, the Swordsman, is unexpectedly defeated in ritual combat by a young upstart, who is then sent&mdash;along with Comet, the Messenger, and other Immortals&mdash;on a mission to Tris, an idyllic and recently discovered island nation. Unfortunately, the Immortals, who assume their own superiority to mere humans, make a mess of things, upsetting the democratically minded islanders and accidentally loosing on them an Insect they'd brought along to help persuade the natives to join the empire.

{"title": "Control Your Destiny or Someone Else Will (Collins Business Essentials)", "content": " Jack Welch is undoubtedly one of the most talked about chief executives in America. Three months apart, two books have appeared about Welch and his mandate to restructure GE in the 1980s. Unlike Robert Slater's The New GE: How Jack Welch Revived an American Institution ( LJ 10/1/92), authors Tichy, a professor and GE consultant, and Sherman, a Fortune reporter, offer a deeper analysis of Welch's leadership practices and philosophies. The authors use the first person singular to signify an insider's (Tichy's) view, which is confusing at first. Furthermore, the addition of the \"Handbook for Revolutionaries\" (material developed at GE's executive education center in Crotonville, New York) makes Tichy appear to be a Welch convert, and the bias is sometimes too obvious. The repetition of ideas makes reading laborious. However, the authors do a substantial job in presenting the research, which included over 100 hours of interviews with Welch.

Still recovering from the emotional devastation of his wife's death, Dr. Brockton stumbles across a mummified female body, and his passion for the truth enmeshes him in a probe that verifies rumors of local corruption. His particular skills are vital to identifying the corpse as well as those who might have been motivated to kill the victim decades earlier.

As Oxford don du Sautoy (The Music of the Primes) tells readers, this is only the tip of the triangle in the mathematical realms of symmetry, where symmetrical objects exist in dimensions far beyond our ability to imagine. The author takes readers gently by the hand and leads them elegantly through some steep and rocky terrain as he explains the various kinds of symmetry and the objects they swirl around. Du Sautoy explains how this twirling world of geometric figures has strange but marvelous connections to number theory, and how the ultimate symmetrical object, nicknamed the Monster, is related to string theory. This book is also a memoir in which du Sautoy describes a mathematician's life and how one makes a discovery in these strange lands. He also blends in minibiographies of famous figures like Galois, who played significant roles in this field.

Growth for its own sake, particularly when it involves diversification into products unrelated to a company's original business, Ries says, causes many companies to become unfocused, confuses customers and loses money. The frenzy for acquisitions that spread many a well-known brand name over a diversity of products has proved untenable, with the result that companies that grew fat are regaining their original focus by slimming down. Sears, Roebuck, a once focused retailer that expanded unwisely into real estate, stock brokering, business system centers and credit cards, is having to divest itself of all but its original retail chain.

When the pace momentarily slackens, the author supplies some nicely observed pastoral views of Dublin and the Irish countryside, but the ongoing cacophony of violence deafens one to all but the most sanguinary details.

Alison efficiently handles the first two problems, hiring attorneys specializing in discrimination and divorce. With her supportive college student son, Chris, she heads for Sedona, Ariz., her hometown, to visit her sympathetic parents and await news of Reenie.

{"title": "Instead of Three Wishes: Magical Short Stories", "content": " Princes in disguise, royal elves and book-loving ghosts all play a part in the seven stories of this intermittently promising collection. Throughout, debut author Turner's style is expansive, allowing for mood-setting details and for occasionally sharp wit, but most of her plots follow familiar, predictable patterns. As a rural town fills up with leprechaun-hunters in \"A Plague of Leprechaun,\" for example, it's easily foreseen that the sole disinterested party, an art school graduate intent on pursuing his craft, will end up with the little green fellow's bag of gold. On the other hand, the entry \"Aunt Charlotte and the NGA Portraits\" is a standout. This carefully framed narrative unfolds slowly and suspensefully to reveal a series of puzzles, their settings ranging from an underpopulated island off North Carolina to Canaletto's Venice, their marvelous resolution followed by a denouement of near-equal magic.

Two crooked NYPD officers who, throughout their careers, worked as hitmen for the Lucchese crime family, the duo came to justice only after 20 years of effort from law enforcement officers determined to put together all the pieces. Dades, a detective on the case, and Vecchione, a prosecutor, tell the story of the professionals who actually broke the case in a thorough step-by-step procedural. Author Fisher keeps the narrative moving with a good balance of police work, politics and mafia drama, channeling with authority (and the coaching of Dades and Vecchione) the voices of the street as well as the police force.

Corso, an investigative journalist whose promising career was derailed by a scandal, is sent by his publisher to a small Pennsylvania town to solve an unusual cold case. In an attempted bank robbery, a seemingly innocuous local, who presented his demands for cash with a bomb strapped around his neck, died when the device exploded. Corso is uninterested in the assignment until his initial inquiries lead to attempts on his life. The case takes on a whole new dimension when similar crimes begin to occur on the West Coast, leading the federal authorities to take a keen interest in the reporter's discoveries.

However, what's useful is that hearing the men described one after the other allows the listener to see the entire male landscape more objectively. But, entertaining as it is, the material is almost entirely anecdotal and falls short of providing any organizing insights women can use when dealing with men's personality and emotional issues. The second complaint is the cutesy framing of this lesson as an investigative crime show with its overly serious narration and silly terms like \"dating diagnostic\" and \"missing boyfriend unit.\" The artifice makes the program sound dumbed-down.

Because it fleshes out some of the gaps in that series, this biography might interest history buffs, and Wilder devotees may snap this up. But by simply shadowing and underscoring her universally acclaimed writings, the book pales in comparison with Wilder's own versions of her adventures.

{"title": "Delivered from Evil: The Saga of World War II: The First Complete One-Volume History", "content": " A one-volume retelling of World War II may seem a dubious proposition, but this veteran writer of popular history has done an outstanding job. Wisely beginning with Versailles, he uses a topical approach to illuminate his vast canvas. There is more storytelling than serious analysis here, but the wartime drama is related with deftness and enticing detail. His portrayal of personalities is excellent. This work is more mature than the author's vaguely unsatisfying Wars of America (1968). He does for World War II what John Costello did for The Pacific War (LJ 12/1/81).

{"title": "A Loss for Words: The Story of Deafness in a Family", "content": " This is much more of a story than the subtitle suggests, beautifully written and deeply affecting. Born in the Midwest in 1952, Walker is one of three hearing daughters of Gale and Doris Jean Walker, both deafened as babies by illnesses. As the oldest child, the author served as her parents' \"interpreter,\" dealing with outsiders. There is humor in her recollections but nothing lighthearted in accounts of crude or condescending reactions to her father and mother from indifferent people. Walker is candid in detailing her own frustrations and the burdens of life with the deaf. Having graduated from Harvard, she eagerly went her own way, establishing a writing career in New York, but she reunites frequently with the family in a home warm with love and shared memories. The reader says a fervent amen when the author declares, \"I'd seen plenty of families where there was more communication and less love.\"Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Admiral Hyman Rickover, father of the nuclear navy, David Lewis, chairman of General Dynamics, and P. Takis Veliotis, general manager of the Electric Boat Division, were at the center of the industrial effort to catch up with Soviet advances in submarine deployment. Following a series of escalating crises, all three fell humiliatingly from graceRickover and Lewis forced into retirement and Veliotis into exile to escape criminal prosecution. The narrative revolves around tape-recordings Veliotis made of his phone conversations with Rickover and Lewis, conversations that began with tentative thrusts and parries and led to the open attacks and counterattacks that brought all three down.

She writes in smooth prose, but her study--based on nearly 400 interviews with different races and ethnic groups--rarely goes deep. Nevertheless, she makes worthwhile points: even working-class Americans believe in the myth of a classless society; divorce often brings economic devastation to women; we have yet to adequately address family needs like day care, parental leave and affordable housing. Fears of joblessness and homelessness have increased greatly among her subjects, and they no longer expect to own homes and live securely.

The Gieses examine the dynamics of Elton's open-field type of agriculture; the division of the villagers into free and unfree, rich and poor; and the relationship between peasants and their ecclesiastical lord. Also discussed are the peasants' simple dress; meager diet; primitive housing; quarrels and lawsuits; sexual mores; rites of marriage, death and inheritance; and penchant for ale. Coroners' rolls reveal that parents frequently neglected infants; court accounts demonstrate that witnesses of crimes were obligated to come to the rescue of the victim.

Constant criticism, for example, is a nonphysical method of control that, if thwarted, may escalate into violence. Therefore, the authors state, a woman married to a manipulative or overly critical man is in a potentially dangerous situation and should make plans to prevent harm to herself and her children. The book's first half, which includes case histories, provides guidelines to help women determine if they are in an abusive relationship.

Some interviewees are well-spoken and discuss specific aspects of ceremonial life. Others, however, make platitudinous or even glib remarks: \"The reason AIDS is here is to show us how to love,\" a woman utters in one of many statements emphasized in outsized type.

This intriguing memoir of growing up in another culture relies on Lively's perception of experience rather than on a detailed chronology of events. Her father, whom she rarely saw, was a manager at the Bank of Egypt; her mother was taken up in the expatriate social whirl. Lively's upbringing was left to Lucy, a young English woman, who was first her nurse and then her governess. The author's impressionistic portraits of Egypt, Alexandria and Palestine evoke sights and smells that are, in many respects, no longer accessible. Already suffering emotionally from parental neglect, Lively was further traumatized when her return to England caused her to be separated from Lucy. A sad and engaging reminiscence.

{"title": "Patton: Genius for War, A", "content": " Perhaps the most renowned and controversial American general of the 20th century, George Patton (1885-1945) remains a subject of intense interest. D'Este (Decision in Normandy) provides new information from family archives and other sources about Patton's ancestry, childhood and pre-WWII military career. This includes his student years at West Point, his experience as a tank officer in WWI and various interwar staff assignments. The author emphasizes Patton's lifelong study and preparation for war and his conviction that God not only chose him specifically to lead an army but also stood ready to intervene to assure him battlefield victories. D'Este has much to say about Patton's impulsiveness, impatience and tactlessness, showing how these qualities often got him in trouble with the public as well as with his superiors. The account of Patton's campaigns from North Africa through Sicily, Normandy and the Ardennes enables the reader to understand why the general is regarded as one of the great military leaders.

Age 26 at the time and feeling lost and desperate after indulging in the excesses of the 1960s, the Jewish author had no real hope for inspiration from the course because of its Christian terminology. But, she writes in this guide to the guide, the program works \"miracles\" for herself and for others who adopt its principles. Her extrapolations may appeal to readers in need of spiritual sustenance, but one questions Williamson's advice to the gravely ill. When she encourages them, for example, to \"write a letter to AIDS or cancer or whatever illness they might have, and tell it everything they feel\"--even to fabricate \"replies\" from the disease--readers are likely to consider that a serious situation is trivialized.

Dillard culls about 40 such happy accidents from sources as diverse as a The American Boys Handy Book (1882) and the letters of Van Gogh. Taking the texts nearly verbatim but toying with theme and line breaks, the poet aims for a lucky, loaded symbolism that catapults the reader into an epiphany never imagined by the original authors. If parts of this collection fall short of that ideal, there are plenty of chuckles and some beautiful turns of phrase. Poems of joy tend to fare better than the more somber efforts. It is hard to play serious with a style that relies on techniques more common in comedy, such as understatement (\"Another legal situation/ Is death\") and double entendre (\"Try dropping from different heights\").

Integrity, he writes, is more than honesty?it requires actions and a willingness to spurn conformity. After his conceptual musings, Carter addresses the role of integrity in performance evaluations (he avoids routine hyperbole), in journalistic objectivity (he thinks the press should apply to itself the standards it applies to others), in law and in sports. Carter virtually ignores the broad question of integrity in business, but he does have interesting, if sometimes convoluted, thoughts on the role of integrity in marriage. He advises caution in legislating integrity in speech or in politics; his arguments spill over, somewhat overambitiously, into suggesting how integrity can help clean up politics (\"We must listen to one another\") and how the concept can help people face larger questions of evil. $50,000 ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Opening with the rationale that ignoring such differences is more dangerous than blissful, she asserts that for most women conversation is a way of connecting and negotiating. Thus, their parleys tend to center on expressions of and responses to feelings, or what the author labels \"rapport-talk\" (private conversation). Men, on the other hand, use conversation to achieve or maintain social status; they set out to impart knowledge (termed \"report-talk,\" or public speaking). Calling on her research into the workings of dialogue, Tannen examines the functioning of argument and interruption, and convincingly supports her case for the existence of \"genderlect,\" contending that the better we understand it, the better our chances of bridging the communications gap integral to the battle of the sexes.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

In the introduction to this book, McLean, one of the most renowned golf coaches in the world, focuses on eliminating the negative thoughts most golfers experience. He throws new light on the game for the beginning or weekend duffer by providing strong commentary on such issues as watching the swings of professional golfers on television and driving the ball with authority. His book's main strength is a wonderfully precise description of golfing's fundamental hip/shoulder turn position, impact, and follow-through. This section aside, McLean is not one to create magic with words. However, his narrative is extremely interesting and informative.

Kasl ( Women, Sex and Addiction ) links addiction and treatment with chakras, nutrition and patriarchy--and she's on target. A.A.'s approach is patriarchal, okay for affluent white men but not for others, especially women, she finds. The book offers numerous, surprising examples of how A.A. meetings, slogans, traditions and steps hurt women: while it might be good for white men to humble themselves and make amends to everyone, Kasl contends that women should ignore that A.A. exhortation--they've done enough of that sort of thing already. Ultimately, everyone's recovery is based on recapturing personal power, recognizing social oppression and revering life. This guide should put some of the needful back on track.

{"title": "Trashing the Planet: How Science Can Help Us Deal With Acid Rain, Depletion of the Ozone, and Nuclear Waste (Among Other Things)", "content": " Some of the authors' major premises are that nuclear power is a safe and cheap source of energy; that acid rain is a vastly exaggerated problem; that chemical pesticides are not as dangerous as they have been made out to be; and that worry over the ozone hole is just an environmental scare tactic. Ray, a marine biologist, former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, and Washington's governor when Mount St. Helens erupted, has a long history of offending conservationists, and most of this book, written with Guzzo, a writer and adviser to Ray during her governorship, is a recitation of statistics and research studies that prove her points. This recitation makes the book tedious, and it is troubling that there are no footnotes or bibliography. A researcher could spend weeks trying to search out the studies mentioned.

{"title": "How We Survived Communism &amp; Even Laughed", "content": " Drakulic's fine collection of essays draws strength from her keen powers of observation and sensitivity to her readers' interests. Her achievement is to depict the starkly common identity of everyday life in socialist Eastern Europe before its unlamented loss becomes irretrievable. It is a world in which party authority can create the \"sudden invisibility\" for an offending journalist, where public buildings share a \"shabbiness and color of sepia,\" and one that makes the post office an impenetrable \"institution of power.\" The essays are also about people, about the obsessive \" communist eye \" (italics original) disturbed by the injustice of New York's homeless yet neurotically envious of those wearing fur coats at home. The tragic irony lies in the book's title. Hoarding material objects enabled people \"to survive communism,\" but hoarding wartime memories and the inability to \"let the dead be dead\" may destroy the author's native Yugoslavia.

In this memoir, Coughlin, the book review editor for the Detroit News , recalls her husband's 10-month struggle to stay alive and her efforts to ensure that he would die with dignity. Her book differs from others of this genre in not romanticizing the suffering she and her husband endured. Optimistic and good humored, Bill was convinced that chemotherapy treatments would slow the growth of his cancer. The Coughlins alternated between confidence and despair until it became clear that there was no more hope. After her husband's death, the author embarked on a mourning that she describes as \"a narcissism that borders on the pathological.\" Offering no panaceas, her candor demonstrates that death and loss are facts of life.

Drawing on 351 respondents, straight and gay, who discussed their erotic lives with him, Morin has developed an \"erotic equation\": attraction plus obstacles leads to excitement. This formula, he avers, is neither tidy nor predictable. He suggests that sexual obstacles in one's youth create lifelong scripts for arousal, while a range of feelings?including exuberance, anxiety and anger?can intensify arousal. Morin advises readers to confront the unresolved feelings that produce \"troublesome turn-ons\" and offers a seven-step guide to modifying or expanding one's erotic patterns. In long-term relationships, Morin observes, passion is hardly guaranteed; he advises couples to recognize and address the interactive tension between intimacy and sexual desire. $35,000 marketing campaign; author tour.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"title": "Kings of Cocaine", "content": " In a riveting narrative based on their prize-winning series in the Miami Herald , Gugliotta and Leen expose in alarming, well-documented and vivid detail the estimated $8 billion-a-year Colombian cartel that controls 80% of the world's cocaine market. In their account, the complex hierarchy of the cartel directs an international operation that resembles and surpasses many multinational corporations in efficiency and sophisticated marketing techniques. Run by a small group of murderous young overlords, the organization has thousands of employees--from peasants and pilots to lawyers and hit-men. Initially, corrupt bank and government officials in Colombia favored the cartel's growth. However, this changed after the cartel's successful opposition to an extradition treaty between Colombia and the U.S., which involved a reign of terror against Colombian institutions. The extended activities of the cocaine barons in Central America have compromised U.S. national interests, the authors maintain, especially in the case of reported contra- cartel links and alleged drug trafficking by Panama's Noriega. Despite concerted law enforcement efforts, the cartel still thrives.

{"title": "Sunset Pass", "content": " Our hero, Trueman Rock, returns to the town of Wagontongue after killing a man and an absence of six years. Many things are different, and as he walks down the familiar streets, he notices many changes in buildings and people. This book was originally published in 1931, and it does not boast the complex story line of many of Grey's other works, but the author and narrator Lloyd James have a great ability to draw the listener into Rock's world as he encounters the vile Ash Preston, who is terrorizing Wagontongue and Sunset Pass with an elaborate cattle-rustling operation. In the midst of all of this, Rock falls in love with Thiry Preston, the innocent sister of the bad guy. One of the strong points of this tale is the shining sincerity with which Grey depicts the story of their love.

Just as Republican candidate Lincoln Howe (read: Colin Powell) is about to pull ahead, his granddaughter is kidnapped. Leahy's own newly adopted baby daughter was the victim of a similar crime eight years earlier. Are the abductions linked? Is someone connected to either of the candidates responsible?

{"title": "Life Sentences: A Novel", "content": " Starred Review. This stunning stand-alone from bestseller Lippman (Baltimore Blues) examines the extraordinary power and fragility of memories. Writer Cassandra Fallows achieved critical and commercial success with an account of her Baltimore childhood growing up in the 1960s and a follow-up dealing with her adult marriages and affairs. The merely modest success of her debut novel leads her back to nonfiction and the possibility of a book about grade school classmate Calliope Jenkins. Accused of murdering her infant son, Jenkins spent seven years in prison steadfastly declining to answer any questions about the disappearance and presumed death of her son. Fallows (white) tries to reconnect with three former classmate friends (black) to compare memories of Jenkins and research her story. In the process, she discovers the gulf (partially racial) that separates her memories of events from theirs. Fallows's pursuit of Jenkins's story becomes a rich, complex journey from self-deception to self-discovery.20-city author tour.

{"title": "The Devil's Star: A Novel", "content": " Starred Review. A serial killer taunts Harry Hole in Nesb&oslash;'s searing third crime novel to feature the Oslo police detective to be made available in the U.S. (afterNemesis). Still suffering from alcohol-fueled demons and obsessed with hunting for evidence against a clearly dirty cop, Hole grudgingly agrees to help look into the murder of a woman whose finger has been amputated and a red diamond stuck under her eyelid. More bodies follow, with the murderer leaving identical five-pointed diamonds (the titular devil's star) at each crime scene. At first the killings appear to be random, but Hole soon discovers an ominous pattern. Nesb&oslash; brilliantly incorporates threads from earlier novels, including Hole's often tumultuous relationship with his lover, Rakel, without ever losing the current story's rhythm. Even with&mdash;or perhaps because of&mdash;his flaws, Hole is arguably one of today's most fascinating fictional detectives.5-city author tour.

{"title": "The War Against Miss Winter (Rosie Winter Mysteries)", "content": " Set in New York City, Haines's assured debut brings the WWII era to vivid life, from a topical jump-rope song (Whistle while you work. Hitler is a jerk...) to Automats and jive joints. On New Year's Eve 1942, actress Rosie Winter, whose day job is with a Manhattan detective agency, finds the body of her boss, Sam McCain, hanging in his office closet, his hands and neck tied with phone cord. The investigating cop calls Sam's death a well-deserved suicide, but there's a missing play that a reclusive playwright and a rich widow want found. Rosie, a fast-thinking Hepburn type, takes on the case, aided by her best pal, Jayne (a petite blonde with... the voice of a two-year-old dubbed America's squeakheart). This is a fun romp, though the author, herself a playwright and actor, provides some dark commentary on avant-garde theater and war as well as an unexpected and wicked twist in the novel's final act.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Blue Zone", "content": " Having coauthored five bestsellers with James Patterson (Lifeguard, etc.), Gross makes a solo debut superior to his collaborative efforts, if short of the first thriller rank. His engaging heroine, Kate Raab, a medical researcher in the Bronx, is shocked when the Feds arrest her beloved gold trader father, Benjamin, and charge him with laundering money for a Colombian drug cartel. A hit team's attempt to kill the entire Raab family prompts all of them, except Kate, to start their lives anew in the witness protection program. Kate's choice, predictably, places her in continuing danger, even as she begins to suspect that her father's involvement with the narco traffickers was more deliberate and extensive than he's willing to admit. The secret revelations at the heart of the plot may strike some as a little far-fetched, and the details about the witness protection program fail to convince, but Gross shows sufficient talent for readers to want to see more from his pen alone.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Sacred Bones: A Novel", "content": " Fans of Da Vinci Code knockoffs will welcome Byrnes's first novel. When an ancient stone burial box known as an ossuary is stolen from a secret crypt beneath the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, readers will immediately intuit that the bones contained in the box are those of Jesus Christ, even though it takes quite a bit longer for the characters to admit as much. American geneticist Charlotte Hennesey is summoned to the Vatican along with Dr. Giovanni Bersei, an anthropologist, to study the ossuary. Back in Jerusalem, Arabs, Jews and Christians bicker, protest, fight and scheme against one another both within and outside the Temple Mount. A ruthlessly efficient Vatican hit man, Salvatore Conte, hovers over the action. Venal cardinals, contemptuous Israelis, Knights Templar and evil popes round out a familiar cast. Byrnes puts a more contemporary spin on his material than most authors of religious thrillers.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."}
{"title": "The Black Tower", "content": " Starred Review. A compelling and sympathetic narrator instantly draws the reader into Bayard's stellar third historical. In 1818, the notorious Vidocq, a master detective who's rumored to work on both sides of the law, pulls 26-year-old Parisian doctor Hector Carpentier into a torture-murder inquiry. The victim, Chr&eacute;tien Leblanc, died without revealing that he was on his way to visit Carpentier, news that comes as a complete shock to the doctor, as the dead man was a stranger to him. Vidocq soon discovers that Leblanc was actually in search of Carpentier's late father, who bore the same name. The elder Carpentier cared for Louis-Charles, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette's young son, who died in prison in 1795. Bayard keeps the reader guessing until the end, though the puzzle aspect is less prominent than in his previous novel,The Pale Blue Eye, which featured Edgar Allan Poe as sleuth.

The stakes rise after the murder of one of the thief's victims. As Emily risks her reputation to solve the crimes, she must contend with a mysterious beau, who woos her in Greek. The author deftly works in background material pertinent to Emily's life as well as period detail that never slows the narrative. Emily sometimes behaves in unlikely ways (e.g., visiting a man at his bachelor residence, getting on a first-name basis with a woman after a brief acquaintance), but readers looking for a lighter version of Anne Perry will be well rewarded.(Apr.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Starring You!: The Insiders' Guide to Using Television and Media to Launch Your Brand, Your Business, and Your Life", "content": " The subtext of this media primer for businesspeople by two veterans of various TV shows is far more interesting than the actual content. Not only do the authors take it for granted that most individuals want to appear on television, but they argue that the very skills that position one for a closeup have universal application beyond electronic exposure. Learning to define yourself as a brand, clarify your message, and convince someone that your idea is worth paying attention to (or, eventually paying for) in a crisp, concise way are valuable tools whether you want to get on television, become head of your PTA, or land that dream job, they coo. They lay out a fairly unsurprising collection of lessons such as familiarizing yourself with the shows, creating something pitch-worthy before pitching and respecting the time of those in the business. Interviews with television insiders slow down what is already a tanklike velocity. Still, if one knows nothing about getting TV exposure, this book may well increase the slim odds of landing a spot.(July 3)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Simon accepts, under the stipulation that he can take her, too. Love soon strikes them, but his determined avoidance of heroics and her desire to lead her kinsmen against the English lead to serious complications.

In this version, the story of Marley, the incorrigible yellow Labrador retriever who could eat the sheetrock right off the wall while retaining his heart of gold remains largely the same, sans the more adult subject matter: marriage, miscarriages, sex and crime. Harris's voice is crisp, sharp and precise, yet filled with warmth, a verbal approach that parallels Grogan's writing style. Trained as a journalist, Grogan naturally balances removed observation with deep emotions. Here, author and narrator make a strong team; this presentation is a great family listen.

{"title": "The Airplane: How Ideas Gave Us Wings", "content": " This history of the development of the airplane by Spenser, a former curator of the National Air and Space Museum and author of747, recasts the Wright brothers' contribution as he widens the scope to aviation history in France, Germany and beyond. Spenser starts with the pioneering work of Yorkshire gentleman Sir George Cayley in the late 18th century, delineates the competitive race between inventors in the early 1900s and culminates (somewhat abruptly) in the world of modern jet airliner travel. Spenser's history reads like a textbook for young, aspiring engineers. Instead of a general chronological approach, Spenser divides the book into sections that each track the development of a different part of the airplane, from the fuselage to landing gear. While this allows him to show how the modern airplane is not a singular invention but rather the cumulative result of thousands of different inventors, trials and errors, it does diffuse the narrative. Still, Spenser's book stands as a smart, and occasionally wonkish, history of a thrilling machine all too often taken for granted.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Authenticity Hoax: How We Get Lost Finding Ourselves", "content": " According to Potter (coauthor ofNation of Rebels), the cost of modernity's dismantling of traditional frameworks of truth and meaning has forced meaning and authenticity to become individual searches that are private and consumercentric. Potter's lively cultural analysis combines an astute analysis of foundational antimodernist thought (in particular Rousseau) with savvy surveys of mass culture to flag the pitfalls and ironies of the modern obsession with authenticity in its every incarnation (authentically punk, spiritual, environmentally conscious) from our jeans to our celebrities. Potter champions a mitigation of modernity's negative, alienating effects rather than a rejection of modernity, and his characterizations of antimodernists can be dismissive to the point of oversimplifying a large and varied spectrum of dissent from the status quo. But in redeeming modernity from primitivists, apocalyptic doom-mongers, and more subtle critics, the author offers a shrewd and lively discussion peppered with pop culture references and a stimulating reappraisal of the romantic strain in modern life.(Apr.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Instead of personal health questions, Bertoldi answers queries like \"Do the dead go to ball games?\" (Yes) and \"How meaningful are coincidences in our lives?\" (Very). The book also has a dishy element, delving into the medium's personal life (her husband's a skeptic) and a number of celebrity encounters. Though generally fun reading throughout, questions of God, heaven and other spiritual matters are met with vague language; she's similarly uninformative regarding practical matters like finding happiness or contacting the seemingly omnipresent dead.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Masculine women, gorgeous sports cars rich with family history, rugged plains, river currents, stubbornness and entropy wend through this spellbinding collection of ten new and 26 previously published stories from prolific Midwestern author Erdrich (The Plague of Doves). Many of Erdrich's protagonists are American Indians (Chipewa, Kapshaw, and Ojibwe feature prominently) of mixed ancestry (French, German, etc.) and difficult means. Erdrich's character-driven stories are rooted in the mystery of the everyday, stretched across the bones of folklore but cured in the brine of modern life: \"as an Indian,\" Gerry finds it \" difficult... to retain the good humor of his ancestors in these modern circumstances\"; another protagonist concludes that \"the only interesting Indian is dead, or dying by falling backwards off a horse.\" Absurdity and a strained sense of humor keep Eldrich's closely observed tales fresh, making it clear that the life of an \"interesting Indian\" takes many shapes.

Alden points out that the Department of Homeland Security concedes that most of its counterterrorism funds are being poured into securing and controlling the border with Mexico and makes a persuasive case that immigration enforcement and counterterrorism are two different things, and for either to be effective they need to be separated.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Lincoln's Men: The President and His Private Secretaries", "content": " This meticulous triple biography looks at Lincoln's three private secretaries, John Nicolay, John Hay and William O. Stoddard. Closer to Lincoln than almost anyone else, these trusted confidantes and advisers handled all of the president's correspondence, acted occasionally as spies and, between Nicolay and Hay, penned the most famous \"authorized\" biography of Lincoln. Though their experiences in Lincoln's administration cast a poignant, personable light on the great president's working life, Epstein's work is far from accessible. The level of detail regarding the three secretaries is exhaustive beyond the interest of anyone but devoted American history scholars. Author and historian Epstein (Lincoln and Whitman, The Lincolns: Portrait of a Marriage) has intimate knowledge of his subjects but little to drive the story beyond the chronological push of history; meandering from man to man, his narrative isn't cohesive enough to hook casual history readers. Though obsessive Lincoln enthusiasts in search of a new perspective may be fascinated, any number of Lincoln books will offer casual history buffs a more engaging examination.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Part one consists of 25 unremarkable tales, including Block's sole foray into science fiction. Offering no defense of their quality in his frank introduction, the author admits that he hasn't reread these stories in decades. Even devoted fans will struggle not to lose patience at encountering yet another grim account of a brutal misogynist who ends up on the wrong end of a gun or a knife. By contrast, the three novellas featuring New York City PI Ed London, starting with The Naked and the Deadly, are taut classic hard-boiled noir, with the gumshoe tangling with treacherous women and lying clients. Closer to the MWA Grand Master's usual level, they blend suspense, a puzzle and an appropriately cynical first-person narrative voice, and will leave even newcomers hungry for more.(Dec.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "God's Battalions: The Case for the Crusades", "content": " It always seems counterintuitive to moderns that warfare and religion can be consistent. Ideally, followers of the prince of peace are to avoid the sword and shield. Clearly, this has not always been the case. Frequently in the crosshairs of critics are the Christian wars against Muslims known as the Crusades, commonly viewed as the birth of European imperialism and the forced spread of Christianity. But what if we've had it all wrong? What if the Crusades were a justifiable response to a strong and determined foe? Stark, a prominent sociologist and author of 27 books on history and religion, has penned a compelling argument that these bloody encounters had less to do with spreading Christianity than with responding to an ever more dangerous enemy&mdash;the emerging Islamic empire. There is much to be learned here. Filled with fascinating historical glimpses of monks and Templars, priests and pilgrims, kings and contemplatives, Stark pulls it all together and challenges us to reconsider our view of the Crusades.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Pioneer Woman Cooks: Recipes from an Accidental Country Girl", "content": " Blogger-turned-author Drummond gives readers a slice of frontier life in this likeable-enough collection of recipes and dispatches from the Oklahoma ranch she shares with her husband and children. Replicating the step-by-step photography that made her blog such a hit, Drummond walks readers through dishes ranging from simple-Guacamole, Chili, Artichoke Dip-to more complex, such as from-scratch Cinnamon Rolls and Sherried Tomato Soup. Drummond's careful coaching will help anyone intimidated by the kitchen fearlessly crank out favorites like Chicken Fried Steak, Meat Loaf and Rib Eye Steak with Whiskey Cream Sauce. While the recipes are reliable home cooking standards, relentless references to her husband, known as the Marlboro Man, range from distracting to juvenile, giving what could have been a comfort food classic the feel of a junior-high class project.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Running from the Devil", "content": " At the start of Freveletti's less than impressive debut, a British Airways flight from Miami, Fla., to Bogot&aacute; carrying 30-year-old chemist Emma Caldridge crashes in the Colombian jungle. Armed men dressed in fatigues start taking the survivors hostage, but Caldridge manages to escape into the forest. A distress call from her cellphone reaches the U.S. government, which recently sent troops to Colombia to help guard an oil pipeline, as well as Darkview, a Blackwater-like outfit assisting the U.S. military with special ops around the world. Caldridge proves amazingly successful at dodging the bad guys, and even uses her professional training to derive digitalis from a plant for a fellow passenger who'll die without it. Cameron Sumner, a member of a drug agency who had special reasons for being on the BA flight, provides the requisite romantic interest. Some may cheer the author's larger-than-life heroine, but the clich&eacute;d action offers nothing thriller readers haven't encountered countless times before.&Acirc;&nbsp;(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Color of Lightning: A Novel", "content": " The author ofStormy WeatherandEnemy Womenreturns with a lively exploration of revenge, dedication and betrayal set mainly in Kentucky and Texas near the end of the Civil War. Britt Johnson is a free black man traveling with a larger band of white settlers in search of a better life for his wife, Mary, and their children, despite the many perils of the journey itself. After a war party of 700 Comanche and Kiowa scalp, rape and murder many of the whites, Mary and her children get separated from Britt and become the property of a Native named Gonkon. Britt must wait through the winter before he can set out to rescue and reclaim his wife and children, only to discover that not only does he not have enough money to bargain with the Indians but also that his own family's fate has as much to do with land disputes and treaties as it does with his determination to get revenge.

{"title": "Womenomics: Write Your Own Rules for Success", "content": " This collaboration between broadcasting powerhouses Shipman and Kay gives career women explicit permission to demand the balance that's been missing in their lives. The authors assert that after decades of trying to outdo men or fighting the Mommy Wars in the office trenches of the 1980s and 1990s, women have gained enough corporate clout to start changing the workplace to suit their needs. Shipman and Kay review the depth of women's influence as consumers and earners, maintaining that their power gives them the right and the ability to ask for flexibility in their work lives, to negotiate assertively and effectively, to say no and to give up the guilt associated with getting their needs met. Through Shipman and Kay's own stories of struggling with demanding work and home lives and anecdotes from other working mothers, the authors make a convincing argument that with some mental and emotional effort, women can create their ideal work and home lives. Filled with pragmatic and optimistic steps, this book will inspire readers to set in motion a flexibility-driven business revolution that can benefit all women and men, families and workforces.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Broker, Trader, Lawyer, Spy: The Secret World of Corporate Espionage", "content": " The tools and tricks once used in the name of geopolitics have increasingly been applied to the private sector, according to this engaging overview of the rise of corporate espionage. With the end of the Cold War, spies on both sides of the Iron Curtain discovered there was money to be made renting out their skills to clients in such fields as pharmaceuticals, banking, and agriculture. Although the historical sections can drag in places, the book gathers steam every time Javers turns his focus to the technologies that have moved the field forward. From early wiretaps to the use of satellites, the author expertly explains how spies help clients sabotage corporate competitors or buy and sell stocks based on expected fluctuations in the price of corn. Generally more interested in strategy and gadgets than the ethical components of spying, the book flirts with painting a romantic picture of the profession before noting the less-than-glamorous occupations of corporate spies, including participating in the battle for supremacy in the pet food market.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "What Would Google Do?", "content": " This scattered collection of rambling rants lauding Google's abilities to harness the power of the Internet Age generally misses the mark. Blog impresario Jarvis uses the company's success to trace aspects of the new customer-driven, user-generated, niche-market-oriented, customized and collaborative world. While his insights are stimulating, Jarvis's tone is acerbic and condescending; equally off-putting is his pervasive name-dropping. The book picks up in a section on media, where the author finally launches a fascinating discussion of how businesses&mdash;especially media and entertainment industries&mdash;can continue to evolve and profit by using Google's strategies. Unfortunately, Jarvis may have lost the reader by that point as his attempt to cover too many topics reads more like a series of frenzied blog posts than a manifesto for the Internet age.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Some may find inspiration in the assertion that all women are hot chicks waiting to discover themselves, and there are a few fun, smart activities like Build a Boyfriend Workshop and the cheeky Where Are His Balls? But any gems are mired in crass hyperbole that often insults readers' intelligence. Some of the content has merit (like most books of this type, the authors preach the virtue of self-esteem) but more often than not the authors present too-cute, sometimes offensive definitions (Butt Class: You may not believe this, but we used to have a lame, flat, white-girl ass until we got that flat ass to the gym) and spout off like sailors on shore leave&mdash;dropping F-bombs with abandon.

Fascination is ultimately an instinctive drive that catalyzes countless behaviors, including purchasing decisions. Outlining seven triggers which \"bring meaning to all types of otherwise meaningless scenarios,\" the author reveals how powerful brands like FedEx, Walt Disney World Theme Park and W Hotels combine such triggers as lust, power, mystique, and trust in different proportions to reel in consumers or reinforce messaging.

Despite his success (and a brilliant facility for self-promotion), few readers know anything about Coelho the man. This authorized biography plunges into the details of Coelho's life, from his perilous birth to his time in asylums to his multifarious spiritual journey to his staggering 25-year writing career. Brazilian journalist, politician and biographer Morais writes with an unapologetic eye, neither judging Coelho nor seeking to justify his actions, smartly presenting the facts for readers' appraisal. Coelho himself provides a generous level of access and candor, giving readers the feeling that they are getting a privileged view despite the biography's \"authorized\" label; what makes Morais' biography especially revealing is his access to years of Coelho's diaries, a goldmine for biographer and reader. Fans of Coelho's work will eagerly tear through this attentive, satisfying biography.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."}
{"title": "The Return: A Novel", "content": " For her follow-up to international bestsellerThe Island, British author Hislop has friends Sonia and Maggie jetting off for flamenco lessons in Granada, Spain. Sonia is escaping monotony and a souring marriage to an older man while Maggie is celebrating her 35th birthday. The trip proves an odyssey of discovery for Sonia, who over a morning cup of coffee is mesmerized by an elderly cafe owner's stories of the Spanish Civil War and the Ramirez family who once owned the cafe and were torn apart during the time of Franco and the upheaval of war. Most intriguing was the story of Mercedes, whose passion for flamenco dancing was matched only by her love for renowned guitarist Javier Montero with whom she performed. Separated from her fractured family, she set out to search for Javier in the chaos of Civil War Spain. Dance holds a place of importance in the tale, especially when Sonia learns the truth about her own mother in a twist that adds suspense to the romance and familial drama. The well-done historical background is a rewarding plus in this fast-paced account of love's power through generations.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the introduction, he accurately and honestly advises the reader that the book is as \"every bit as self-indulgent as it wanted to be.\" Block goes on to provide lengthy details of his various forms of ambulation, from long solo walks as a seventh grader to a walk across Spain to Santiago de Campostela. Mostly he recounts his experiences as a runner and a racewalker in races ranging from 5Ks to marathons and 24-hour races. Runners or walkers will enjoy Block's accounts of his trials and triumphs, including a strange hiatus of more than 22 years. (Block was in his 40s when he stopped racing and in his 60s when he resumed walking marathons.)

{"title": "The Official CIA Manual of Trickery and Deception", "content": " Intelligence historian Melton and retired CIA officer Wallace (coauthors ofSpycraft) reunite for this unremarkable reproduction of a long-lost cold war&ndash;era relic. In 1953, the fledgling CIA hired professional magician John Mulholland to adapt his techniques of stealth and misdirection to the craft of espionage. Mulholland produced two illustrated manuals featuring a range of tricks from placing pills into drinks to stealing documents and avoiding detection. The classified manuals were believed to have been destroyed in 1973, but the authors discovered a copy in 2007 among recently declassified CIA archives. The manuals are reproduced along with enhanced illustrations and an extended introduction by Melton and Wallace. Despite the authors' best efforts to promote their discovery of Mulholland's work as a rare piece of historical evidence of the CIA's legacy of black arts, the manuals, with their earnest, how-to descriptions of surreptitiously spiking drinks, palming documents and signaling colleagues with a feather in a hat band seem more quaintly anachronistic than revealing or sinister.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Each victim received a postcard depicting a coffin just before the murder. The FBI turns to Will Piper, a talented agent with a bad attitude who's counting the days to retirement. Teamed with young agent Nancy Lipinski, Will tries to identify the killer from practically nonexistent clues. There are suspenseful moments as Will and Nancy race against time&mdash;with inevitable romantic involvement, once Will stops scorning Nancy because of her weight&mdash;but long tedious stretches focus on Will being drunk, drinking on the job or complaining of hangovers. Flashbacks to 1947 and the medieval setting that inspired the killer are poorly integrated, and while the secret behind the deaths is original and clever, its revelation is anticlimactic.(Aug.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "After You Believe: The Forgotten Role of Virtue in the Christian Life", "content": " How do you develop a character suited for God's Kingdom? Practice, practice, practice. That, in a nutshell, is the message of this volume on building Christian character by Wright, a prodigiously prolific Bible scholar and Anglican bishop of Durham, England. In arguing for this new vision of virtue, which is a vision of Jesus Christ himself, Wright carefully explores such classical exponents of character as Aristotle. He also acknowledges the existence of other notions of encouraging behavior-based rules, duty, or being true to oneself. Drawing on scriptures from Genesis to Revelation, Wright asserts that true transformation comes through the work of the Holy Spirit and through worship, mission, and following Jesus. As the habits of virtue grow, the church community will become the royal priesthood it is meant to be, anticipating (one of the author's favorite words) God's coming new world. A follow-up to Wright'sSimply ChristianandSurprised by Hope, this solid volume will appeal to Christians who appreciate biblical interpretation that hews to tradition but incorporates an emphasis on contemporary social justice as an element of Christian virtue.(Mar.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "In Praise of Doubt: How to Have Convictions Without Becoming a Fanatic", "content": " Sociologists Berger (The Social Construction of Reality) and Zijderveld (The Abstract Society) inveigh against the dogma of isms that replace humor with certainty and thoughtfulness with blind action. Between the extremes of fundamentalism and moral relativism sits the doubter, perched on liberal democracy, which the authors describe as a three-legged stool, balanced on the state, civil society and the market economy to promote debate and dissent. Berger and Zijderveld illustrate the obvious perils of extremism, but are less adept at navigating moderation. They apply their doubt premise to abortion, capital punishment and immigration policy, and come to inoffensively moderate political positions, but their tepid recommendations lack appeal; as the authors admit, The agnostic position is by definition a weak one. What recommends doubt as a concept is that it defies stringent characterization.

They made money \"protecting\" merchants and through holdups and invasions of homes, and their victims were always other Asians. One of their number, Tinh Ngo, was repelled by the gang's bloodthirstiness and became a police informant. Thanks to him and to city and federal officers, seven of the gang were apprehended, tried in 1992 and given long prison sentences, the leader, David Thai, getting life.

Opening with a broad and light cultural history of tipping, the book then delves briefly into the tip's primary restaurant industry role before moving on to its impact in lesser known and often neglected businesses by examining their gratuity-related transactions. There's enough raw, self-deprecating autobiography to keep the anthropological enterprise comic; in addition, the author steps in the shoes of those in various industries and discloses the hidden codes of parking valets, Starbucks \"tip jars,\" and the beauty industry. Dublanica breaks down a dizzying variety of service-related exchanges along with the inner worlds of casino dealers and sex-trade workers (in fact, there's an awful lot about Vegas) and even provides a couple of tip-helpful appendixes.

{"title": "Red November: Inside the Secret U.S.-Soviet Submarine War", "content": " Reed's personal experience as a navy recon diver, submarine weapons technician, and special ops photographer informs every page of this exhaustive and fascinating account of submarine technology and warfare from the end of WWII through the cold war. The author's father, William J. Reed, a navy communications specialist, helped develop the hardware that made possible long distance frequency direction finding that allowed listening stations to pinpoint the far away locations of ships or submarines. These HFDF stations, called \"Huff Duffs,\" were instrumental in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. Reed presents a vast cast of interesting characters and a daunting array of scientific technology, but manages to keep the material understandable, fresh, and exciting as befits a book devoted to the underwater world of high stakes submarine warfare. Decades-long gag orders keep participants from revealing really up-to-date secrets, though it's chilling to learn that from 1995 to 2005 the Chinese navy has launched 31 nuclear submarines.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

St. Claire's sister has died of a shotgun blast to the head in Georgia, a death ruled a suicide by the local authorities, but St. Claire suspects her brother-in-law killed her sister. Brockton's efforts to preserve evidence that could support St. Claire's theory ends up taking a backseat to another puzzle, based on events at an actual Florida reform school, where boys were routinely physically abused.

Though Herendeen claims she's merely unearthed the hidden story from clues already written into the original, what unquestionably occurs in this unlikely redo is erotic, witty and as often silly as refreshing. Here, Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy match wits and sexual appetites while engaging in same-sex relationships, she with older-and-wiser Charlotte, he with younger and pliable Charles Bingley, who struggles with his attraction to Elizabeth's sister, Jane.

This time around, Austen's glamorous cousin Countess Eliza de Feuillide (once known as simply Betsy) takes center stage. Suggesting that Eliza made a significant impression on Jane's development as an author, Pitkeathley depicts a spirited woman who certainly made an impact on the entire Austen clan, as well as stole her share of hearts, including her first husband Jean Capot, the Comte de Feuillide, who was guillotined in 1794. Pitkeathley (Cassandra and Jane) explores several impressions of Eliza, who ultimately married Jane's brother Henry, through the various perspectives Austen family members; while Jane's is naturally appealing, Eliza's viewpoint is far more fascinating, especially as she worries about her impending death from breast cancer.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The author makes a cogent case against several misguided government policies, from destructive urban renewal schemes to asbestos-abatement hysteria, but inflates the particulars into an attack on liberal \"rationalism,\" the desire to use reason to solve human problems and a refusal to acknowledge that \"this is not a universe governed by logic.\" Insufficient citations and such claims as \"no one goes without  care\" in the U.S.\" sap the book's authority and might well prevent Dunn's own \"well-meaning\" arguments from finding wider credence.

Chapters include these students' work; Rosenblatt's humor, wit, and wisdom; and classroom discussions of questions both obvious (how does a story differ from an essay?) and remarkably precise (how does James Joyce convey so much in the first sentence of \"Clay\" and what does it all mean?). The author repeatedly points out that he cannot teach his students to be professional writers, but rather to simply write better than they did before. Less a how-to book than a measured reflection on teaching, the work nonetheless offers aspiring writers many concrete suggestions (let your nouns do the work; go for imagination over invention; write with \"restraint, precision, and generosity\").

The collection is bracketed by two very short stories (the title story and Her Hand) built around picture postcards (indeed, postmarks appear at the beginning of each story), and the varied stories between them all move with transparency; Greenman's prose is polished to a fine gloss that handily guides the reader along. While some stories only get a few details&mdash;two stories with cloyingly cute and very long titles are among the shortest; their titles virtual punch lines&mdash;others spin on, dominated less by substance than by stylistic demands, as with Seventeen Different Ways to Get a Load of That, which documents a relationship breakdown in short numbered cuts.

The author ties together diverse political, economic, and cultural threads in describing the rise (and brutal suppression) of the \"ethnically diverse, politically astute, and highly organized\" army, and investigates why this \"story more Braveheart than Beloved\" was consigned to historical footnote. While the book's ambition occasionally exceeds its grasp, it vividly evokes the atmosphere of New Orleans of the early 19th century and how a recalcitrant, French-rooted Louisiana and some Spanish possessions in the Deep South were incorporated into the expanding American nation though brutal revenge justice and political pressures.

{"title": "The Mendacity of Hope: Barack Obama and the Betrayal of American Liberalism", "content": " Left-wingers and right-wingers looking for Obama-bashing will find ample ammunition in veteran journalist Hodge's critique of the current administration. Hodge relates  the high expectations for \"Archangel\" Obama, despite his corporate ties and his Congressional voting record. With Obama's cabinet, Hodge says, we saw that \"change\" was not on the table so much as continuity, that  the health care reform bill proved a disappointment, and that the military situation remains the same. Furthermore, Obama's \"record on torture, detention, and executive authority is even worse,\" and \"our constitutional system may never recover.\" Hodge, former editor in chief of Harper's Magazine, supports his arguments with lengthy discussion of historical politics, from the founding fathers through the Clinton and Bush administrations, and ends with a call to voters \"to alter its mode of government\" and \"provide new guards for our future security.\" Hodge's first book will interest a broad audience, from activists seeking to change the \"political will\" to academics seeking historical context.(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

When the wildly unpopular Colonel Protheroe is found murdered in the vicar's study, it seems that everyone&mdash;his unhappy wife, his daughter, a visiting artist, an embittered poacher, the vicar&mdash;has a motive in a mystery that confounds the authorities, consumes the village and can only be untangled by observations and deductions of our heroine: the elderly gossip-cum-sleuth Miss Marple.

As Susan and Jamie are caught up in a plot involving international traffic in historical artifacts, they must flee their pursuers through the countryside. Grace Conlin's facility for dialect enriches this pleasant mystery from the author of The Ape Who Guards the Balance (Audio Reviews, LJ 3/15/99).

Using her own experience and those of others in the same predicament, she describes the various paths to childlessness--infertility, not having wed, a difficult marriage--and the ways in which feelings of loss may manifest themselves. In one upbeat section, she outlines 10 \"steps to resolution,\" from acknowledging the loss and letting go of blame to thinking of oneself as \"childfree\" instead of \"childless.\" And for those who want to join forces with other childfree women, she explains how to start a self-help group. The book contains interesting case histories, but Anton's tendency to romanticize motherhood and her sometimes self-pitying tone leave the impression that she herself has never really come to terms with being childless. $30,000 ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

The fabric of conversation is woven from such diverse fields as analytical physics, development of dogma, karma, and ecology. Orthodox Christianity will struggle with various assertions (e.g., a discomfiture in using the term \"God\" and a certain downplaying of the specifics of world religions in order to showcase their sameness and universality).

{"title": "To Dwell in Peace: An Autobiography", "content": " One of the most seminal of counterculture leaders in the 1960s and, arguably, the most notorious of Jesuits, Berrigan recounts his life in this moving, reflective and poetic autobiography. Beginning with his strong-willed family\"The ill luck principle applied here with a vengeance\"he recalls his roots, his origins among a people who knew hardship. His entrance into the Jesuit community was both a withdrawal from that life and a wondrous opening to another. In the long period of preparation for priesthood, Berrigan blossomed as teacher, poet, charismatic leader of college students, notably on the Cornell campus. Paying tribute to Dorothy Day and to her style of Christian community that influenced him, he describes his soul as \"moving in a contrary wind.\" His acts of civil disobedience with his brother Philip, also a priest, their arrests and convictions, are well known. Today, Berrigan, a member of the Jesuit community in New York City, remains actively engaged in social causes. In this assessment of his life, the 66-year-old author shows that his fidelity to the precepts of Ignatius Loyola endures. Photos not seen by PW.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

By chance, Arvigo met 87-year-old Elijoio Panti, the best-known Maya medicine man in Central America. She persuaded him to teach her about the medicinal plants of the rain forest and the Maya art of healing. With freelance writer Epstein, Arvigo presents an engaging account of her five-year association with Panti and his patients, affording an interesting glimpse of traditional healing. Ultimately, Arvigo obtained the support of the American Cancer Institue and the New York Botanical Garden for her study of natural healing; she is now director of research of Terra Nova, a 6000-acre plant reserve in Belize.

Author of Shaman: The Wounded Healer , Halifax believes that deep ecology (which attempts to fuse environmental awareness with spiritual values) ranks with Buddhism and shamanism as a way to understand the interconnectedness of all creation and to regain a view of life as sacred. In rapt prose she recounts her explorations--geographic and mental--from Japanese Zen meditation to hallucinogenic plants, from the Dogon people of Mali to the Mayan rain forest.

{"title": "Transformation: Understanding the Three Levels of Masculine Consciousness", "content": " On the heels of Robert Bly's best-selling Iron John ( LJ 11/15/90), comes this slim volume which offers quite a different assessment of maleness and its self-completion. Johnson, author of Inner Work ( LJ 7/86) and We ( LJ 2/1/84), uses three literary archetypes: Don Quixote (simple, two-dimensional man); Hamlet (complex, four-dimensional man); and Faust (complete, four-dimensional man). As a result of modern education and urbanization, Johnson posits, Western man is no longer simple; yet he lacks self-determination and therefore is trapped. The insights found here seem applicable to universal self-fulfillment and provocation (e.g., what significance does Faust's victory over the devil hold for men in these AIDS-ridden, economically troubled times?). Also, where Bly's book demands action, Johnson's is purely cerebral and more interesting to readers familiar with classic literature.- David Nudo, New YorkCopyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

It is a well-developed manual of how one can live a good life as defined by the tenets of Taoism. The author wonderfully blends the philosophy of Taoism with discussions on exercise, diet, sex, lifelong learning, discipline, nonviolence, and many other topics. In addition to being wide in scope, this book is most remarkable for its tone. Written in the form of a master speaking to a student, its lessons are expounded in a quiet, personal manner.

{"title": "Facing Codependence: What It Is, Where It Comes from, How It Sabotages Our Lives", "content": " This book stands out among the current glut of material on codependence because it claims the realm of parenting for its vantage point. The authors believe that codependents must heal themselves in order not to repeat the \"less than nurturing\" behaviors of their own addicted or emotionally dysfunctional parents. Hence, they couple strategies for recovery with guidelines on what is and is not \"normal\" in the parent-child relationship. The authors' conclusions will invite controversy; for instance, they suggest that \"emotional sexual abuse\" of children may lead to homosexuality in adulthood. Nor are they reluctant to generalize: \"Although physical and mental illness aren't addictions, their effect on the family is the same.\" Offsetting the opinionated commentary is great compassion for the helpless, hurt children who live inside adult codependents.

Using examples from history, mythology, and religion, Johnson, author of Inner Work ( LJ 7/86) and Transformation ( LJ 8/91), offers a tour of the shadow, showing its origin and features, and demonstrating how and why it bursts into consciousness when least expected. Returning to the subject of his earlier work We ( LJ 2/1/84), the author reveals how experience of romantic love may lead to awareness of both positive and negative aspects of the shadow, and how integrating the shadow into one's personality can be a challenging religious experience.

{"title": "The universe story: From the primordial flaring forth to the ecozoic era--a celebration of the unfolding of the cosmos", "content": " Physicist Swimme ( The Universe is a Green Dragon ) and historian/theologian Berry ( The Dream of Earth ) fashion a cosmology with alternating chapters of popular astrophysics and a kind of sociology of science that seems, at the start, like a secular Book of Genesis. The admixture of physics and anthropology soon decays into an artificial comprehension akin to the most irresponsible New Age reasoning. In the \"Primordial Flaring Forth\" section, the authors discuss their perceived need for a new language to express a current cosmology: \"Thus to articulate anew the story of our relationships in the world means to use the words of one of the modern languages that implicitly, and to varying degrees, obscures or even denies the reality of these emerging relationships.\" Offering evidence that, among other things, first cousins should not marry, this soft union of theology and physics reveals less about the universe than either field can by itself. The writers' tortured prose will likely offend the scientific sensibilities of most general readers.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "The Original New Testament: A Radical Translation and Reinterpretation", "content": " The author of The Passover Plot offers a translation of the entire New Testament (the first one-man translation since J.B. Phillips's version.) As one would expect, there are controversial elements in the translation itself and in the introductions. For example, attempting to be completely objective, Schonfield avoids certain well-established but ecclesiastically ``overloaded'' terms, such as supervisor for bishop and envoy for apostle. However, supervisor and envoy are not neutral terms; they have their own connotations. A one-man translation will not rival the significance of the ``official'' translations, but because of Schonfield's reputation this present work should achieve some popularity. Comparing it with the ``official'' translations will give a fresh experience of the New Testament text. John Moryl, Yeshiva Univ. Lib., New YorkCopyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

{"title": "Undercurrents: A Life Beneath the Surface", "content": " Manning, a clinical psychologist, led a busy life as therapist, mother and psychology professor at George Mason University in Virginia when, in 1990, she sank into crippling depression. Obsessed with images of death and plagued by suicidal thoughts, she vainly sought relief through antidepressants and psychiatric counseling. Simmering with misplaced anger at her husband, Brian, and fearful that their daughter, Keara, could not rely on her, Manning finally agreed to her psychiatrist's recommendation to submit to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In this sensitive journal covering the period 1990-1991, she credits electroshock with lifting her out of a life-threatening depression, though she concedes that it caused some memory loss and confusion. She also continues to cope with much smaller depressions and may have to take antidepressants or lithium for the rest of her life.

His holistic approach to wellness addresses attitudes and core beliefs, vocation and emotion, as well as physical habits and nutrition. The advice is sound and sometimes unexpected: \"stress is to be not only expected but preferred.... The problem isn't stress, it's toxic stress.\" Despite the rigid connotation of the title, these \"laws\" are generous and encouraging, reflecting Anderson's accessible presentation of material in aphoristic, anecdotal chapters.

Besides sex addicts, Schaef ( Women's Reality ) here profiles two other types of addicts: \"romance junkies,\" who seek escape from true intimacy through pseudo-relationships, and \"relationship addicts\"preoccupied with a particular person or with the need to have a relationship, real or fantasied. A former psychotherapist, Schaef insists that addictive ties are reinforced by underlying sick tendencies in our frantic, competitive culture. Romance addicts, for example, mesh with society's illusionary focus, which reinforces their avoidance of life's hard realities.

{"title": "The Grandma Mix-Up (I Can Read Book 2)", "content": " From an accomplished author/illustrator comes a sweetly child-centered I Can Read. Pip's parents are going on a trip and there's a mix-up. Mom asked Grandma Nan to baby-sit while Dad asked Grandma Sal. The grandmothers arrive, and agree that they'll both stay. Active and stylish, Grandma Nan demands a neat room and strictly nutritious meals. Laid-back and cozy Grandma Sal would rather watch the ball game with her feet up, or offer Gummy Bearsstet caps before lunch. Pip is uncomfortable with the opposing forces. \"I want to do things OUR way, like everyday when Mom and Dad are home,\" he asserts. Chastened, Grandma Nan and Grandma Sal agree on this sensible course. McCully has once again focused her wry humor on a situation of genuine concern to children: the security of family routines. She illustrates this charmer with warmly humorous watercolors, with all the droll details for which she is known.

The author's note identifies Tom as a real person and supplies basic facts of his life, but the story focuses only on \"Will and Orv's\" visits to Kittyhawk. The fictionalized dialogue is fairly realistic and the story line progresses at an even pace.

{"title": "Finding Providence: The Story of Roger Williams (I Can Read Book 4)", "content": " Grade 2-4?Told in the voice of Roger Williams's young daughter, Mary, this brief chapter book recounts the most dramatic period in Williams's life, prompted by his expulsion from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his dissenting views. The tale opens with a hearing in which John Cotton questions him and concludes with the founding of Providence, Rhode Island. As might be expected in a 48-page book for beginning readers, the portrait Avi draws is necessarily sketchy: only the high points of Williams's character and beliefs are covered. Nonetheless, he does capture some of the man's integrity and convictions. And by placing the voice of the story with Williams's young daughter, the author conveys some of the poignancy of the situation. Although some of the character's features are blurry, the full- and half-page watercolor illustrations are realistic and balance the text nicely.

Hearing that there will be no mail because the deep snow has made it impossible to cross the mountains, Danny feels hopeless. John Thompson, a Scandinavian immigrant, steps forward and tells the boy, \"There is a way.\" The next day John shows Danny how to make skis and shortly thereafter embarks on a 90-mile journey through the Sierra Nevadas. \"You can count on me,\" he says.

Although Amelia never meant to do anything more than literally run to the office, an encounter with the mayor and a reporter soon has her in the thick of a political campaign. Such literal mindedness is what gives Amelia her charm, and there are plenty of instances of humorous confusion in this latest installment in the series. If not quite to the level of the original titles written by Peggy Parish, the author's nephew does a satisfactory job of carrying on the traditions of wordplay and wacky complications that have made Amelia Bedelia such a beloved character.

A little longer and more complex than most texts for the series, this one starts with a common childhood experience, pushing toy cars across the floor--and gradually--introduces ideas such as forces, reactions, inertia, friction, and gravity. That's a lot to explain in a short book, and some of these concepts are difficult to simplify. To her credit, Bradley, the author ofEnergy Makes Things Happen(2003), does grapple with fundamental concepts rather than taking the easier, more traveled, less-satisfactory road of, say, talking about gravity in terms of \"up\" and \"down\" or simply describing its observable effects. Colorful line-and-watercolor-wash illustrations brighten the pages. The final spread offers instructions for a simple activity leading to a better understanding of friction.

Pearson's work is based on Jungian psychology, which holds that archetypes are forms or images of a collective nature, which occur not only as myths but also as individual products of the unconscious. Using examples from advertising and marketing and consumer, popular, and organizational culture, she and Mark show that successful brands draw on responses to such archetypes as the hero, outlaw, lover, sage, magician, creator, and innocent, and that these responses cross lifestyle and cultural boundaries. They examine ways to determine which archetypal meaning is best for one's brand and provide a model for doing so.David RouseCopyright &#169; American Library Association. All rights reserved"}

The book emphasizes the importance of staying connected to children as they grow into adolescence. Shaffer, an educator, and Gordon, a clinical social worker, explain the cultural and social constraints behind boys' unwillingness to talk. Fearful of the appearance of vulnerability, boys aren't willing to risk exposure of their feelings by talking and instead use competitiveness as an acceptable model for expressing emotions. The authors provide strategies for enhancing opportunities to connect more deeply and emotionally with boys and explore the cultural conventions regarding ideals of masculinity, encouraging parents to help teens develop more independent and individual self-images. Particular issues facing boys of color are addressed in separate chapters. The authors also offer specific strategies: for instance,  boys need to be taught empathy; and parents need to value attachment in their sons as well as their daughters.Vanessa BushCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

{"title": "Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns", "content": " It's no secret that people learn in different ways, so why, the authors of this book ask, \"can't schools customize their teaching?\" The current system, \"designed for standardization,\" must by its nature ignore the individual needs of each student. The answer to this problem, the authors argue, is \"disruptive innovation,\" a principle introduced (and initially applied to business) by Harvard Business School professor Christensen in The Innovator's Dilemma. The idea is that an audience in need will benefit from even a faulty opportunity to fulfill that need; in education, the demand for individual instruction could be met through infinitely customizable online computer-based instruction. The authors, all professionals in education, present a solution to the ills of standardized education that's visionary but far-fetched; even they admit that their recommendations would be extremely difficult to implement in current school systems. Still, the authors' unusual case, though occasionally bogged down in tangents, is worthy reading for school administrators, teachers, parents and, perhaps most of all, software developers.

{"title": "My Turn to Speak: Iran, the Revolution and Secret Deals With the U.S.", "content": " Bani-Sadr, who was president of Iran after the overthrow of the Shah and a close advisor to the Ayatollah Khomeini, reveals a great deal regarding behind-the-scenes U.S. involvement in Iranian politics. Now living in exile in Paris, he breaks his long-held silence to expose the dealings of three U.S. presidents with the Iranians as well as to describe the duplicity of Khomeini, who the author argues betrayed the spirit of the revolution. Bani-Sadr claims that the Reagan election team conspired with the Iranians to withhold the release of the hostages until after the election, thus permitting Reagan to claim the credit. He also makes some interesting comments about the involvement of Reagan and Bush in the Iran-contra arms scandal. This is a tale that is absolutely essential to read in order to appreciate contemporary Iranian politics and the 1979-80 revolution. For a wide audience.- Sanford R.

{"title": "Illegal Action", "content": " Starred Review. MI5 officer Liz Carlyle tries to make the best of it after she's unwillingly transferred from counterterrorism to counterespionage in Rimington's excellent third novel (afterSecret Asset). Assigned to a case involving a rich Moscow oligarch living in London, Liz quickly realizes that there's considerable evidence the oligarch's been targeted for death by someone in Russia&mdash;perhaps with the assistance of the Russian government, perhaps not. Matters become more complicated when it becomes evident Liz herself may wind up a target. Rimington's command of espionage and counterespionage history and techniques (derived from long personal experience at the same British agency as Carlyle's) enables her to bring enormous believability to her well-paced narrative. Her dialogue moves as swiftly as the action, and her characters are as believable as the world in which they&mdash;and we&mdash;live.

And chances are good that once readers accept Fox's hard-hitting yet commonsense approaches, they'll accept his sales process, which applies, by the way, to selling widgets, promoting intangible services, or selling yourself. Every one of the author's 50 two-page to four-page chapters contains just one nugget of information more than the preceding section, enough to keep the momentum and the attention. A sad story about the hazards of drinking coffee (it spilled--and the prospect was then distracted by a second crisis) is followed by a notice not to eat a major meal during a sales lunch, which is promptly followed by \"no pen in the shirt pocket\" advice. Fox's seemingly disparate hints and tips, in short, comprise a very logical and memorable way of rainmaking, and a short tome that will show anyone the how-tos.Barbara JacobsCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

{"title": "Martin Misunderstood", "content": " Who'd have thought that the disrespect and indignities Wayne Knight suffered as Newman on theSeinfeldseries would have been just a warmup for the silly, tasteless and at times repugnant, racist and unfunny material that Slaughter has provided. The author's original audio novella focuses on murder suspect Martin Reed, an &uuml;ber-wimp who lives with his shrewish, nagging nightmare of a mother and who works at Southern Toilet Supply. His home life is an indication of Slaughter's originality; his occupation suggests the level of her humor. Knight, making his audio debut, gives the material his best, which is considerable. His familiar image also adds much needed dimension to Martin's flimsy construction. But the novella is so unnecessarily ugly and hopelessly lacking in either invention or humor one can only presume that the potential forMartin Misunderstoodwas, well, misunderstood.(July)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Put On By Cunning (Wexford)", "content": " It has been said that the dramatic works of Shakespeare were written not by the poet-impresario but by another man with the same name. This is basically the plot of this otherwise very sophisticated and very English mystery by the author of such works as The Crocodile Bird (Audio Reviews, LJ 5/15/94). The term \"anticlimax\" scarcely does the work justice. In addition, reader Charles Kay, though sensitive and skilled, has a rough and not-very-pleasant voice. Also, the story, set in Thatcher's London suburbs, has a more than full complement of characters, several of whom are already dead when the action begins.

The second part deals with authentication, or proof of identity on a network. The benefits and pitfalls of different schemes are discussed in a lively and engaging way and are spiced with appropriate quotes throughout. In the final section, E-mail-for some the most chaotic risk of all-is examined. Terms are defined well even for beginners, and exercises at the end of each chapter allow you to test your comprehension of a given set of concepts. But the authors use a notation system (discussed in the introduction) that you'll need to understand to follow some of the examples and arguments.

{"title": "Coping with Toxic Managers, Subordinates ... and Other Difficult People: Using Emotional Intelligence to Survive and Prosper", "content": " Lubit, an academic, psychiatrist, and management consultant, explains how our ability to work effectively with difficult or \"toxic\" managers will have a significant impact on our careers. By improving this ability, he claims, we will learn to better understand and manage ourselves. The first order is to increase our emotional intelligence, comprising personal and social competence. These competencies are our abilities to understand our own feelings, strengths, and weaknesses, and to control our emotions while also understanding the feelings of others and developing skills to form positive relationships with them. Lubit delineates the behaviors of five types of toxic managers--narcissistic, unethical, aggressive, rigid, and impaired--saying that these behaviors are manifestations of depression and fear. By understanding them, we will be able to design strategies to protect ourselves.

Who we become (or have become) is largely determined by the choices we make, and the author believes that much of what we call \"luck\" is really good decision making. The topics covered include establishing clear goals, understanding rationality, personality tests to provide insight into how individuals make decisions, tolerance for risk and its impact on decisions, controlling emotions, the tendency to be overconfident, and ideas for overcoming biases and errors. We can never be too accomplished at decision making, and Robbins' roadmap gives helpful instruction that will appeal to a wide range of library patrons.

Tracing the actor's life from his birth in 1901 in Cadiz, Ohio, to his death at age 59, the author (Robert Taylor, etc.t describes the women he attracted: his first wife, drama coach Josephine Diller who helped start him in his movie career; later wives and lovers, who included Joan Crawford, (possibly) Loretta Young, Grace Kelly et al. Gable, according to Wayne, dominated women as he dominated the screen in such classics as It Happened One Night and Gone with the Wind, but Carole Lombard, his third wife, was his equal. When she died in a 1941 plane crash, Gable courted suicide as an Air Force officer during World War II.

In farfetched allusions to problems overcome by Sitting Bull, the authors urge politicians, CEOs and public services chiefs to emulate the Sioux leader's qualities--commitment, integrity, courage, statesmanship and vision--qualities successfully employed by executives of the few firms cited here. Murphy and Snell propose three phases of action divided into 13 steps: to restore the nation's confidence, to mobilize its resources and to develop Sitting Bull-like leadership.

{"title": "The Winner's Circle: How Ten Stock Brokers Became the Best in the Business", "content": " The authors believe that current interest in the stock market justifies interviewing ten top producing brokers to determine their techniques, strategies, and career philosophies. While they say that they couldn't find any \"stereotyped personality that lends itself to being a successful stockbroker,\" there are some common traits: tenacity, conscientiousness, commitment, and integrity--qualities probably contributing to success in any field. All the brokers profiled here seem to have had a turning point (a stroke of luck?), after which their careers blossomed. All serve clients who are not making their own decisions, and the authors claim that the average investor can learn from them by comparing their character and moves with those of their own brokers to decide if they are being well served. Perhaps readers who are already stockbrokers can emulate those presented here. For larger business collections due to the limited audience.- Alex Wenner, Indiana Univ.

Beginning with Attila's attack of Rome, which was likely stopped by dysentery, and continuing through modern diseases such as AIDS and the Ebola virus, Clark investigates a large number of illnesses and uncovers the ways in which they have impacted historical events. The same genes that provide humanity with protection against some endemic diseases, Clark argues, may also cause sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. With wit and humor, the author turns death, an ever-heavy topic, into an engrossing exploration of the course of mankind.

{"title": "Simple Art of Vietnamese Cooking", "content": " This excellent introduction to Vietnamese cooking will provide a good starting place for ignoramuses and a stock of useful recipes for know-it-alls. Duong, owner and chef of Truc Orient Express restaurant in Hartford, Conn., and Kiesel, of Food & Wine magazine, carefully itemize preferred equipment and the many ingredients used in Vietnamese dishes. Recipes appeal not just with their delicate interplay of flavors and textures, but with a golden opportunity to alter one's diet. Vegetables, spices and rice make up the bulk of a meal. And, as with most Asian fare, meats and fish are used to flavor, not to dominate, a dish. Several intriguing Buddhist vegetarian recipes are included. All are well organized, and directions are easily navigated. Some recipes may call for as many as 15 ingredients, so be prepared to spend some time chopping and measuring. Cooking time is quite brief. Because Vietnamese cookery relies on many exotic items--tamarind pulp, starfruit, tiger lily buds, pandan leaves--the authors have thoughtfully provided a mail-order reference source.

{"title": "Queer: A Novel", "content": " In an introduction, Burroughs observes that he wrote this heretofore unpublished picaresque novel in 1951, well before Naked Lunch established his reputation. He reveals that the book had its genesis in a terrible event: his accidental shooting to death of his wife, Joan, a tragedy that released the black wellsprings of his talent. The narrative recounts the hallucinatory life of William Lee, an American in Mexico City in the 1940s and his journey to Ecuador with his reluctant lover, Eugene Allerton, in search of the drug Yage. Lee is Burroughs after the killing, weighed down by guilt, drugs, lust and despair; seeking lethe. Admirerers will find an early exposition of Burroughs's later themes here, as well as a strain of gallows humor. The work is almost cinematic as it unfolds; the author is not yet experimenting with the meaninglessness of language, and, indeed it is thin in both thought and expression.

{"title": "The Jewish People: Their History and Their Religion", "content": " For the overwhelming majority of Jews under Roman rule, Jesus of Nazareth was just one more tragic, fallible victim of the struggle against an oppressive regime. In this scholarly history by two London rabbis of the Progressive branch of Judaism, unfolding events are interpreted as they were felt and lived by the Jewish people. Ever since the French Revolution, when Judaism lost its hold as an all-embracing amalgam of faith and behavior, Jews' responses to the modern world have ranged from conversion or assimilation to fervent nationalism. The narrative, alternately brisk and dry, helps explain how a tiny, persecuted, exiled people maintained a distinctive cultural identity and sense of mission. In extensive sections on ethics, belief, literature and worship, the authors take a refreshingly unconventional approach. Reminding us that \"Old Testament\" is a Christian term alien to Judaism, they reexamine the Jewish Bible's sense of the cosmos as a unitary whole. Their view of Judaism as a set of mitzvoth (commandments), a code of conduct that each believer must rediscover, informs this challenging study.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Holly's \"hold on his fans is to be explained by his very humanity,\" the authors maintain, and, appropriately, they take pains to separate fact from legend.

Recounting MCA's 62-year rise from Chicago dance-band booking agents into the \"General Motors of Hollywood,\" Moldea (The Hoffa Wars charges that Reagan, while Screen Actors Guild president in the early 1950s, helped create the unprecedented deal that made MCA a powerful force in TV.

The family as revealed here was poor and abused by an alcoholic father, once a trumpet player with the Hoagy Carmichael band but whose later poor-paying jobs made him increasingly bitter. The author writes of siblings whose adult lives were badly affected by their drunken, hostile father whom they nevertheless remember with affection.

Caught by U.S. customs authorities, Mason found himself facing the shame of trial and the terror of prison.

Though his style is bland, the author draws on disciplines from anthropology to history and ecology to offer intriguing insights. He begins with the domestication of fire, its impact on agrarianization and its place in ancient Israel, Greece and Rome--where the private fire brigade was instituted. Goudsblom also assesses the significance of fire in culture, suggesting that dread of hell-fire developed as people learned to fear fire in war and in cities. Looking at fire in the industrial age, Goudsblom notes that progress brought the safety match and better fuels as well as greater military destruction and planned, contained forest fires.

The 11 articles and two interviews (with Edward Said and Harold Bloom) represent a group of prominent writers of the new PC (politically correct) humanities departments, which are (according to the authors) maligned by conservatives such as Dinesh D'Souza ( Illiberal Education , LJ 3/15/91), David Lehman ( Signs of the Times , LJ 3/1/91), and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Instead of discussing the decline of humane learning owing to the advance of multicultural studies, feminism, deconstruction, or other ills, the authors explain that a new humanism is emerging as an international doctrine without boundaries by nations or other groupings.

Making technical concepts accessible, Davies surveys attempts by Stephen Hawking, Murray Gell-Mann and others to reconcile Einstein's ideas with quantum physics. Among the time-bending phenomena he investigates are black holes, collapsed stars that may abolish time at their centers; kaons, subatomic particles attuned to the expansion of the universe; and antiworlds, hypothetical neighboring regions of space-time in which time flows backward. The author's speculations on causality, God and eternity make this a rewarding tour de force for nonspecialists.

{"title": "Riding with the Lion: In Search of Mystical Christianity", "content": " The journeys of contemporary spiritual seekers are often marked by the search not only for the soul's home but also for a true leader who, like Dante's Virgil, can accompany them on their quest of self-discovery. Markides here provides a kind of spiritual travelogue in which he chronicles his own search for authentic teachers of the sophia perennis. From his study of the Orthodox Christian mystical tradition, the author draws parallels with the spiritual principles enunciated in Hinduism, Buddhism and other Eastern systems of religious expression; he even counsels ways of distinguishing false teachers from true ones. Unfortunately, however, the book is marred by a soupy spirituality whose attempt to synthesize a variety of beliefs and practices into a universal spirituality represents the worst of the New Age. The book will, nonetheless, have wide appeal to those readers seeking the simple integrations of pop spirituality.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"title": "Longing for Darkness: Tara and the Black Madonna", "content": " An alcoholic single mother of three, Texas-born Galland ( Women in the Wilderness ) was raised a strict Roman Catholic, turned to Zen Buddhism, then became obsessed with Tara, the female Buddha of Tibetan tradition, and her counterpart, Kali, the black Hindu goddess, death-dealer and life-giver. In black images of divinity the author sought a touchstone for transformation, an avenue to the unconscious. In a baroque church in Switzerland she observed the Black Madonna, a virgin painted coal-black who holds a black Christ Child in her arms. In India she discussed women lamas with Tibet's Dalai Lama in exile. Her 1987 trip to Poland turned up another Black Madonna but also exposed her to a different kind of darkness: secret police, racism, Auschwitz. Blending travelogue, free-floating meditation, autobiography and adventure, her intensely personal narrative is a disquieting spiritual odyssey.

All employed what Feuerstein, author of books on yoga and religion, calls \"holy madness\" or \"crazy wisdom,\" using eccentric behavior or shock tactics to communicate an alternative vision. A former devotee of Da Free John (aka Da Love-Ananda, ne Franklin Jones), Feuerstein presents critical cameos of holy fools (Aleister Crowley, BhagwanRajneesh, etc.) as well as guidelines for choosing a wise, enlightened guru and avoiding the exploitative. Yet his gallery of spiritual eccentrics is so diverse--ranging from Christian mystics to Hindu holy men who live on garbage heaps--that it's hard to credit the author's generalizations about the value of holy folly as an authentic path to transcendence.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition."}
{"title": "Zen and Us", "content": " Initially, this attempt to explain why Westerners should consider Zen suffers from its heavy-handed attack on Christianity, seen as a monolithic ritual rather than as the potpourri it is.

{"title": "Teach Your Child How to Think", "content": " Some parents may be confused by this busy primer, while others will agree with the author's premise that creative thinking skills can be directly taught. De Bono, a business and educational consultant, asserts that this manual is equally applicable to teaching children or senior executives. Crammed with exercises, games and diagrams, the book stresses that thinking involves \"operacy\"--the skills of doing or making things happen--as well as devising mental patterns more effective than the mind's routine habits. De Bono ( I Am Right You Are Wrong ) takes a no-nonsense approach, pointing out that much thinking is inefficient and that many highly intelligent people are not good thinkers. He urges the use of speculation, hypotheses, provocation and other techniques as a way to get out of mental ruts and generate ideas.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

In March it opened in the United States on Broadway, with direction by Mike Nichols and starring Glenn Close, Richard Dreyfuss, and Gene Hackman. The play focuses on a woman who finds herself in the position to exact revenge upon a man whom she believes to have been her torturer 15 years earlier. In telling this story, the author also addresses the dilemmas which touch all our lives: innocence and evil, truth and lies, forgiveness, and revenge.

{"title": "A Fish in the Water: A Memoir", "content": " In a dramatic, ebullient memoir, eminent Peruvian novelist Vargas Llosa recounts his unsuccessful bid for the Peruvian presidency in 1990 on a reformist platform. Believing private enterprise to be the driving force of economic development, Vargas Llosa, who promised to end state control of the economy, discrimination and entrenched class privilege in Peru's multiracial society, rejects the oft-repeated thesis that Alberto Fujimori, who won the election, has appropriated his ideas. On the contrary, he criticizes Fujimori's regime as authoritarian and destined to propagate backwardness. The author's political saga alternates with frank chapters on his childhood, adolescence and development as a writer. His autobiography is of equal interest as a political statement and a literary testament.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"title": "Sharpe's Sword", "content": " This powerful, exciting novel, the fourth in Cornwell's fine series on the Napoleonic Wars (e.g., Sharpe's Honour, Audio Reviews, LJ 5/15/95), focuses on a key turning point: Wellington's defeat of the French in the Battle of Salamanca. Sharpe, who embodies the heroism of the common soldier, dies a dozen deaths in his struggle against Colonel Leroux, the man responsible for killing Britain's top spies. Sharpe falls into the beguiling Marquesa's web, blissfully unaware that the actions of this passionate beauty will determine victor and vanquished. The author details military strategy, pits infantry against cavalry, and shows how class considerations impact the entire conduct of the war, including medical treatment of wounded officers and low-born soldiers. A valuable epilog reveals how closely the recording captures the historic individuals and locations. The television miniseries and reader Frederick Davidson's performance will provide a large audience for this outstanding work.

The product is an insightful and provocative meditation on how people can become more genuinely engaged and successful in pursuing their goals?in school, the workplace and relationships. Concerned with what makes people want to succeed, Deci conducted extensive studies demonstrating that when subjects are encouraged to pursue a task for its own sake, they do it better and enjoy it more than those told to do it for a reward or informed that they will be punished if they don't do it correctly. These results lead to his conclusion?amply illustrated through anecdotal and scholarly evidence?that authoritarian motivational strategies such as the reward/punishment systems commonly used in American schools and businesses alienate people from their work, make them less productive and leave them less fulfilled. Deci calls for \"autonomy-supportive\" behavior from those in positions of authority to encourage motivation emanating from within.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

{"title": "I Don't Have to Make Everything All Better", "content": " Based on Gary Lundberg's work in family and relationship counseling, this revised version of a self-published work wisely maintains the deliberately simple narrative voice of the original. The authors call for \"validation,\" a powerful technique for improving one-on-one communication that involves careful, empathetic listening to another person's feelings without judging, criticizing or attempting to solve his or her problems. The authors demonstrate this technique's startling effectiveness in a variety of situations and provide readers with valuable coaching and specific responses, cautioning that authentic validation is grounded in respect and honesty, or else it might be seen as manipulation. The Lundbergs include many recognizable examples from their workshop practice and from their experience as parents of five. Some sample situations may be resolved a bit too easily for some tastes, but even the most jaded reader is bound to learn from the material, which holds special appeal for parents of young children. Anyone who has been confronted with a spouse or a child who had a bad day, a cranky customer, colleague or demanding relative stands to benefit from the Lundbergs' advice.

{"title": "Reagan's America: Innocents at Home", "content": " Ambitious and insightful, this study examines aspects of Ronald Reagan's life and career that account for his extraordinary popularity with the American public. Wills, author of Nixon Agonistes and Inventing America, portrays a Reagan whose optimistic personality is in harmony with the deep instincts of Americans. The President, he maintains, embodies the country's values and its collective dreams and memories. In his show-business years, Reagan was \"the voice of midwestern baseball\" and \"the plain-spoken hero of horse epics\"; later, as Hollywood union leader and California governor, he was the complete \"company man.\" As President, his simple answers in the face of troubling complexities have let Americans feel positive about themselves. While sometimes overdetailed, Wills's study succeeds admirably in isolating the sources of Reagan's appeal. Photos not seen by PW.

Through her use of primary-source materials such as letters and diaries, the author personalizes this history without whitewashing it. She also captures the prejudice faced by those women with nerve enough to assist in the war effort in a more public way, especially their poor treatment by men. In one of the most vivid passages, she describes Sojourner Truth facing down an audience of hostile men and bringing them to their feet cheering.

The poet and his family put in appearances in several parable-like stories, and Dobyns reworks myths in stories about Midas, Orpheus, Odysseus and Theseus. Throughout his work, there is a disturbing amount of pessimism. The extent of random evil in his universe outdoes even the dourest of existential philosophers.

{"title": "Pnin (Penguin Modern Classics)", "content": " Nabokov fans will be disappointed by narrator Stefan Rudnicki's stiff, staid performance in this audio version of the author's 13th novel. Told in a series of vignettes, the story follows Russian immigrant and professor Timofey Pavlovich Pnin as he boards the wrong train on his way to deliver a lecture, loses his luggage, struggles with the English language, hunts for living quarters, deals with his ex-wife, and throws a faculty party. Rudnicki's narration is clear and steady, but fails to capture the playfulness of Nabokov's prose and the humor of the text. Instead, Rudnicki's tone is variously stiff, needlessly booming, or monotone. He does, however, provide a wide range of voices for the cast of characters. His rendition of the title character-which sounds like a hybrid of Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat and Soviet comedian Yakov Smirnoff-is dynamic and entertaining.

After his charismatic father makes a class visit to talk about Iroquois culture, his peers begin to warm up to him. Bruchac, author of numerous books with Native American themes, weaves into the story the legend of the great peacemaker Aionwahta, who united five warring Indian nations into the Iroquois Confederacy and turned an enemy into an ally. Can Danny be, like Aionwahta, an agent of peace, and find a way to transform the school bully into a friend?

{"title": "The Penguin Atlas of Food: Who Eats What, Where, and Why", "content": " By means of colored maps, bar graphs, pie charts, and data tables, Millstone and Lang make comprehensible a wealth of complex statistical data on where the food we eat comes from, who eats what, who produces it, and what that means for nutrition, the environment, and economics. In full-color graphics, the authors show how nations compare with one another on such diverse topics as disease, over- and under-nutrition, animal feeds, pesticide use, trade flows, staple foods, fast food, alcohol consumption, and advertising. The authors clearly intend to demonstrate the results that globalization and technological advance have wrought. Graphs on food aid clearly show that despite its huge aid outlay, the U.S. actually contributes through governmental channels comparatively little of its wealth. Supplementing the graphs, a massive table lays out precise numbers from which the graphs were generated, and a bibliography provides guidance through the source documentation. Most all data cover the years 1999-2001. This is a significant and valuable guide to worldwide food-related statistics.Mark KnoblauchCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

This is the first U.S. publication of his first novel, which was written in 1963. It is the story of Elizabeth Reegan, who, after years of being alone, marries a widower with three children. Her husband, a policeman, is a hard and bitter man who never passes up the opportunity to stick it to his rule-mongering boss. Endless chores and her deep awareness of her inability to soothe her husband's restlessness or to be an essential part of her stepchildren's lives have left Elizabeth dispirited. When she learns that she has breast cancer, her feelings about the futility of her life deepen, but she also sees the value in trying to meet her fate with dignity.

As the Nazis march into Vienna, British paleontologist Quinton Somerville decides to save 20-year-old Ruth Berger, daughter of his Jewish-Austrian colleague, by marrying her and whisking her off to England, where the couple plan to obtain a quick annulment. Naturally, complications delay the dissolution of their marriage, so Ruth enrolls in London's Thameside College, where Quin is a highly sought-after professor. Indeed, wealthy, aristocratic Verena Plackett has set her cap for him. Ibbotson's spirited novel features atmospheric locales--Budapest, Vienna and the Somerville estate in Northumbria among them--and a colorful supporting cast of European refugees whose eccentric behavior mystifies their upper-class British sponsors.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

She didn't understand them. They no longer stopped by her office for consultations, no longer did assigned readings or participated in class discussions; they openly took naps in class, brought in food and drink, and behaved as though their education was of no importance to them. Looking for a way to close the gap between her and her students, Nathan enrolled in her own university as a freshman. Over the year, she gained an understanding and appreciation of contemporary college life. She found that many students who seemed uninterested in the whole idea of school were actually intensely curious and passionate about their education. They weren't the problem; the institution of learning was. This book offers insightful exploration of contemporary higher education and fascinating commentary on the ways in which the system has not kept up with the ever-changing needs of its students.David PittCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

When Katy Devlin, a 12-year-old girl from Knocknaree, a Dublin suburb, is found murdered at a local archeological dig, Det.

There are chilling similarities between the Devlin murder and the disappearance 20 years before of two children from the same neighborhood who were Ryan's best friends. Only Maddox knows Ryan was involved in the 1984 case. The plot climaxes with a taut interrogation by Maddox of a potential suspect, and the reader is floored by the eventual identity and motives of the killer. A distracting political subplot involves a pending motorway in Knocknaree, but Ryan and Maddox are empathetic and flawed heroes, whose partnership and friendship elevate the narrative beyond a gory tale of murdered children and repressed childhood trauma.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "There Once Lived a Woman Who Tried to Kill Her Neighbor's Baby: Scary Fairy Tales", "content": " Masterworks of economy and acuity, these brief, trenchant tales by Russian author and playwright Petrushevskaya, selected from her wide-ranging but little translated oeuvre over the past 30 years, offer an enticement to English readers to seek out more of her writing. The tales explore the inexplicable workings of fate, the supernatural, grief and madness, and range from adroit, straightforward narratives to bleak fantasy. Frequently on display are the decrepit values of the Soviet system, as in The New Family Robinson, where a family tries to outsmart everyone by relocating to a ramshackle cabin in the country. Domestic problems get powerful and tender treatment; in My Love, a long-suffering wife and mother triumphs over her husband's desire for another woman. Darker material dominates the last section of the book, with tortuous stories, heavy symbolism and outright weirdness leading to strange and unexpected places.

Amazingly, Burbank discovered independently the Mendelian principles that form the basis of genetics, and developed more than 800 varieties of fruits, nuts, vegetables and flowers.

Brand haphazardly organizes his manifesto into chapters that address environmental stewardship opportunities, exhorting environmentalists to become fearless about following science; his iconoclastic proposals include transitioning to nuclear energy and ecosystem engineering. Brand believes environmentalists must embrace nuclear energy expansion and other inevitable technological advances, and refreshingly suggests a shift in the environmentalists' dogmatic approach to combating climate change. Rejecting the inflexible message so common in the Green movement, he describes a process of reasonable debate and experimentation.

It's earnest and heartfelt, but there's no story. Gilbert's encapsulations of her research cannot sustain the reader's interest, and her forays into amateur anthropology in Southeast Asia are crude and uncharitable: she vacillates between tropes of the happy savage and crowing that the Hmong women she interviews will never know her level of education, health, and agency.

Listeners may catch glimpses of creativity and consciousness, but Lynch's rants lack cohesion and substance. Within the audiobook's short chapters, Lynch barely broaches a topic before moving onto the next, leaving listeners to question his emphasis to go \"deep.\" The most interesting aspects arise out of his anecdotes and comments about his films, likeEraserheadandBlue Velvet. His dry rattling voice hints at the passion behind his statements, but more often comes across as insistent and almost whiny. He reminds listeners that authors do not always make the best voices for their books.

{"title": "Gal: A True Life", "content": " Born in 1961 of a 13-year-old mother--father unknown--Ruthie Mae, or \"Gal\" as she was known, was raised in a Charleston, S.C., black island community as a virtual slave to a drunken, sadistic step-grandfather who beat his wife to death. After years of theft, alcohol and drugs, Gal doggedly--almost to spite her grandfather--graduated from high school as a means of survival. The harrowing, oral account of the girl's travails conveys the author's lively portraits of a motley cast of characters (all bearing pseudonyms). Becoming a prostitute to flee her brutal first husband, Gal was happily transformed by a second marriage and motherhood. The abundance of sordid detail may daunt some readers, but from it all emerges the portrait of a remarkable woman, still \"tasting and peering, touching, listening.\" Author tour.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "The Fate of Katherine Carr", "content": " Starred Review. George Gates, who once toured the world as a travel writer, churns out fluff pieces for his local paper and spends his nights alone, imagining what he'd do to the person who murdered his eight-year-old son seven years before and is still at large in Cook's eerily poignant novel. When Arlo McBride, a retired missing persons detective, tells Gates about the unsolved disappearance of reclusive poet Katherine Carr 20 years earlier, Gates is intrigued. Cook (Master of the Delta) seamlessly intertwines the short story Carr left behind&mdash;about a woman also named Katherine Carr&mdash;with Gates's growing obsession with Carr's fate. When his editor suggests that Gates write a profile of Alice Barrows, an orphan girl dying of progeria (premature aging), he discovers that Alice is an avid detective fan, and together they form an unlikely partnership. Adept at merging past and present plot lines, Cook eloquently examines the often cathartic act of storytelling.Author tour.

{"title": "Apollo: The Epic Journey to the Moon", "content": " Among the many books written on the history of the Apollo program, this one, by classical archaeologist Reynolds, stands out. The author of six previous books, including Star Wars: The Visual Dictionary, Reynolds looks back on the history of Apollo from the perspective of the 21st century. NASA, despite its success, was not the flawless government agency many believed it to be, and the lunar astronauts themselves were not simply one-dimensional heroes but complex human beings with failings. Nevertheless, America won the race to the moon, and this book re-creates the drama the whole world experienced over 30 years ago. The well-written text is accompanied by numerous photos and drawings much more so than most other works on Apollo history. The author's explanations of complex technological matters are easy to understand, and readers will appreciate the small details he recounts, such as how astronauts repaired a fender on the lunar rover with duct tape.

{"title": "A Comrade Lost and Found: A Beijing Story", "content": " Starred Review. As a young student, award-winning Canadian journalist Wong (Red China Blues) spent a year in Beijing on a foreign exchange program during the cultural revolution, and in this suspenseful, elegantly written book, she recounts her return to the city in an effort to find a former classmate she betrayed with grave consequences. As a fervent young Maoist eager to fit in with her compatriots, the author had voluntarily informed on Yin Luoyi, who had been interested in visiting America at a time when expressing approval for the imperialist running dogs could lead to expulsion, ostracism or worse; Yin was expelled from the school. Wong returns to a transformed Beijing. Gone is the semirural capital where the author's revolutionary course of study included bouts of hard labor and self criticism sessions. In its place are eight-lane expressways lit up like Christmas trees, shiny skyscrapers and the largest shopping mall in the world. Wong is a gifted storyteller, and hers is a deeply personal and richly detailed eyewitness account of China's journey to glossy modernity.(Feb.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Big O", "content": " While Irish author Burke (Eight-ball Boogie) has been compared to Elmore Leonard, this effort falls short of Leonard's superior blending of crime and dark humor. The impending parole of violent armed robber Rossi Francis Assisi Callaghan sets in motion a cascading series of events. Callaghan's ex-wife, Karen King, herself a thief, fears he'll come after her, and seeks to get herself some insurance in the form of professional kidnapper Ray Brogan. Ray, in turn, is hired to abduct Karen's friend, Madge Dolan, by her husband, Frank, a plastic surgeon who wants to cash in a lucrative insurance policy. The waters are further muddied by questions about Callaghan's parentage and the introduction of a vicious, half-blind dog named Stalin. The broadly drawn figures and situations are clearly not intended to be taken seriously, but the absence of any character a reader is likely to sympathize with is a significant drawback.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Dodge Dynasty: The Car and the Family That Rocked Detroit", "content": " Skilled and esteemed mechanics in Detroit at the turn of the century, John and Horace Dodge were uniquely situated to take advantage of the burgeoning automobile industry. First they made engines for Oldsmobile and then for Ford, who in due course eased them out. The brothers became immensely wealthy, but they made no provision for their heirs to carry on the auto manufacturing firm they built into an industry leader. Both died in 1920. The subsequent history of the family, carefully researched and dramatically related by Latham ( Life with Rose Kennedy ) and Dodge \"intimate\" Agresta, is one of squandered opportunities, failed marriages and general unhappiness. As the authors aptly put it, the tragedy of the family was that it realized the American dream. Illustrations not seen by PW.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Beginning his careful investigation, the detective relentlessly questions a shady restaurateur but gets no solid leads to the imported criminals or their presumed victim. Maigret gradually realizes that friends from the FBI are working behind his back and pride insists that he compete with them to solve the case.

{"title": "Liberators: Fighting on Two Fronts in World War II", "content": " Companion volume to an upcoming PBS special, this work recounts the tragic saga of the 761st Tank Battalion, whose African American personnel trained for two years in the racist backwaters of the South, made a major contribution to Gen. George Patton's Third Army in the WW II European campaigns, then returned to the U.S. after the war to find that discrimination against them had grown worse. The 761st's military record is impressive. The battalion fought farther east than any other U.S. unit (but was prevented from making the historic link-up with the Red Army, a ceremony reserved for white troops), and led the way for U.S. forces in the liberation of Jewish survivors at Dachau and Buchenwald. In the saddest irony of all, the authors (all New York City film producers) describe how the African Americans received a warm welcome in England and from German civilians during occupation duty, and as a result were roundly resented by their white comrades in arms.

{"title": "Mother's Ordeal: One Woman's Fight Against China's One-Child Policy", "content": " This is the story of the ordeal of Chi An, a Chinese mother, and her fight to escape being a victim of China's family-planning policies of the 1980s. These allowed no more than one child per couple under threat of public criticism, heavy fines or job demotion. Mosher ( Journey to the Forbidden China ) dramatically portrays the hardships imposed by the Cultural Revolution, particularly by government population control. This included mandatory use of IUDs; the presence of community spies; raids during which pregnant women were dragged to clinics for forced abortions (often in the third trimester of pregnancy); and the sterilization of both men and women--procedures at which, as a nurse, Chi An was obliged to assist. Having conceived a second child while traveling in the U.S., Chi An and her husband would have been deported without the author's successful appeal, which helped establish China's one-child policy as ground for political asylum.

{"title": "White Wave: A Chinese Tale", "content": " Kindergarten-Grade 3.  A well-told Chinese folktale, first published in 1979 (Crowell), has been reissued with a handsome new jacket and a few changes in the text. The moon goddess, White Wave, appears in the form of a moon snail to keep house for a poor farmer. When he discovers her in human form, she ascends to heaven in awesome glory, but promises to return in his hour of need. Wolkstein has added an author's note to this version, made some editorial changes, and given the farmer a name. Young's black-and-white pencil drawings, repeating the spiraling moon snail motif while poignantly evoking the farmer's loss and White Wave's majesty, come to the new edition unchanged. They are now printed on matte paper with red borders and subtle illuminations of silver and look slightly more dramatic than they did in the earlier edition. Libraries with a clean copy of the older version may not need this new one.

{"title": "Working Cotton", "content": " A hot, arduous and typical day in the life of a family of migrant cotton pickers is the subject of Williams's striking first picture book. Shelan describes how her parents, brothers and sisters arrive at the cottonfields before dawn and toil till night to fill sacks with the fluffy white harvest. At times both gritty and poetic, Williams's text is written completely in Shelan's dialect. Though the phrasing may require careful reading, it adds a necessary authenticity to the story while presenting a difficult way of life. However, the author does not pass a negative judgment here: her characters play, sing and admire nature--when they have the chance. Bayard's intense acrylic paintings capture the beauty of the California landscape as well as the intensity of human struggle--thoughtfully reflected in her cast's sweaty faces. Vast fields of white cotton tufts against an endless blue sky create an appropriate sense of isolation. Though some may object to the portrayal of African Americans picking cotton, Shelan's family is to be respected for embracing life and doing whatever it takes to make their way in the world.

{"title": "Water", "content": " Stylistically and thematically reminiscent of Asch's recent The Earth and I, this picture book offers variations on a basic ecological concept: the importance (and omnipresence) of water. With simple, declarative sentences, the author runs through a litany of definitions, from the specific (\"Water is rain. Water is dew\") to the abstract (\"Water is high in the sky. Water is deep in the earth\"). Unfortunately, the cumulative effect of the \"Water is\" construction is tiresome; teachers and purists may object to misleading statement (\"Water is what fish breathe\"). The accompanying watercolor and acrylic illustrations are appropriately liquidy and abundantly prismatic, with colors bleeding into one another for a rainbow effect. The result includes striking, multicolored snowflakes, confetti-like rainstorms and striped waterfalls. Wavering between narrative and nonfiction, this title struggles to find an appropriate audience.

{"title": "Disappearance: A Map: A Meditation on Death and Loss in the High Latitudes", "content": " The loss of a colleague whose Cessna 340A disappeared between Yakutat and Juneau (an area known as Alaska's Bermuda Triangle) prompted the author to examine other disappearances in that vast state. A former editor of Alaska's Wildlife, poet Nickerson reaches back to early frontier Alaska, to the Russians, American missionaries, Sir John Franklin and subsequent polar expeditions, including those of Captain Bob Bartlett and Vilhjalmur Stefansson. She also meditates on another kind of loss?the disappearance of the shamans, language and culture of the natives and of the land's natural resources. Nickerson follows recent disappearances of hikers, climbers, tourists and adventurers (in 1991, the Coast Guard launched 1192 rescues, with 45 reported fatalities).

{"title": "Clabbered Dirt, Sweet Grass", "content": " Gary Paulsen, author of adventure novels for young people, shows us a world of unremitting hard work and self-sufficiency in his powerfully elegiac account of the seasonal activities of a multigenerational farming family of Scandinavian descent on the northern Great Plains some 70 years ago. This is not exactly Lake Wobegon, but akin to it. Uncertainties and rewards provide a theme. Spring represents a time of birth for animal stock. Summer means plowing, collecting wild fruit and canning garden produce on wood stoves. Fall brings the harvest and its chores--killing animals for meat--while winter, nominally a period for the farm to rest, entails gathering firewood and logging timber (a cash crop). Everybody worked, even when they relaxed at the end of the day--women quilted or crocheted, and men sharpened tools as they spun tales. Any reader with a rural background will be transported by Paulsen to the past.

{"title": "The History of Hell", "content": " In an arresting journey through the netherworld, Playboy fiction editor Turner explores the landscape and dynamics of Hell as envisioned by writers, artists, theologians and thinkers from Plato and Augustine to Milton, Calvin, Byron and T. S. Eliot. Starting with the worlds of the dead of the Sumerians, Egyptians, Zoroastrians, Greeks, Romans and Jews, Turner moves on to the sketchy biblical basis for Christian Hell and its increasing importance in thinking about the afterlife. After the fact of Hell was settled, it was up to writers like Bede, Gregory the Great and most of all Dante to give the graphic descriptions of an infernal region where the wicked endure torments. Enlightenment thinkers like Voltaire poured cold water on the idea of Hell, yet, as Turner shows, Hell, far from disappearing in the 20th century, has been one of its central metaphors. Scores of intriguing black-and-white plates reveal how Bosch, Giotto, William Blake, Michelangelo, Rodin and others have shaped popular images of the underworld.

Topics range from notes he's sent people who have dared to correct his grammar, to letters to old friends and enemies on matters dealing with English usage, to book reviews, interviews, selected columns, essays and even obituaries, the last of which are especially flavorful. The book's conclusion is worthy of Dr. Johnson himself, a 100-page \"lexicon\" of words and phrases?partita, paternalistic, paucity, pedagogical?used over the years by Buckley. Much of this book has already appeared in print scattered over a lifetime of publishing, but Buckley's admirers will be delighted by the generous sampling of the author's correspondence.

{"title": "The Reader's Companion to Cuba", "content": " Journalist Ryan (Reader's Companion to Mexico, Harcourt, 1993) has brought together articles excerpted from the works of 23 authors, ranging from Anthony Trollope to Pico Iyer, who give us a portrait of Cuba as seen through travelers' eyes. The pieces are arranged chronologically, starting in 1859 and ending in 1992. Richard Henry Dana and Anthony Trollope visited the island at the same time and had very different views. Dana loved it, but Trollope found few attractions in Havana. He thought that the United States should take it over, as indeed the United States wanted to do. Langston Hughes, in his 1930 visit, found the color bar worked against him, mostly because of American influence. While this is not a political book, most of the recent authors find the American embargo and policies to be wrong-headed, though many find flaws in the policies of the Cuban government.

Weapons are banned on Earth, while each nation's robot army runs an arms race on the moon. When the governments of Earth become concerned that the machines are planning an invasion of the mother world, the Lunar Agency dispatches Tichy and several remote-controlled robots to investigate. What Tichy finds on the moon provides Lem with a first-class opportunity to skewer military thinking and arms-race politics (it's to the author's credit that his deft takeoff of the Cold War in no way seems dated). Even stranger, however, is what happens to Tichy himself-a bizarre encounter with an unusual weapon results in a unique twist on the theme of split personalities.

Here he swarms over the reader from each of these directions, describing in amusing-to-ribald fashion his experiences in labs and at seminars with famed scientists in San Francisco, Paris, Vienna, Trieste and elsewhere. His theme: that contemporary science, with its almost-daily discoveries and apparent marvels, seems firmly oriented toward the future, but underlying its key assumptions is a \"system of belief\" still tied to 19th century mechanistic determinism despite the innovations of Einstein, quantum mechanics, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and molecular biology. Berlinski's intellectual roller-coaster comes at last to the notion of randomness, and in brilliant but dizzying final chapters that discuss DNA, catastrophe theory, metric space and \"life as a language-like system,\" he seems to arrive at a nonmystical vitalism that may well bring his peers to their feetcheering or protesting.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

{"title": "Radical Reflections: Passionate Opinions on Teaching, Learning, and Living", "content": " With lighthearted anecdotes, poems, letters, and other writings, the renowned Australian children's book author entices teachers to do more writing themselves and rejects the \"skills-and-drills\" mentality in language arts teaching. Fox, an advocate of the \"whole language\" movement, fiercely condemns the use of basal readers in reading instruction classes. Their dullness, she maintains, causes students to avoid reading altogether. Fox recommends instead that real books be read and real language used. She advocates stories that bring teacher and student together in a relationship to experience genuine feeling, laughter, and fun. A superb writer, she constructs an excellent case, and surely any child would like to be a member of her reading/writing class. Her ideas are jotted down in a rather disorganized fashion, but her writing is fresh.

Evidently, Woolf had to endure quite a lot of rubbishy fiction during these years, but she usually managed to find something positive to say, and a few essays stand out in the way they seem to point to Woolf's gestating fictional vision. Overall, these are polished works of literary journalismshrewd, deft, inquisitive, graceful, and often sparkling.

{"title": "Money Mischief: Episodes in Monetary History", "content": " From the Micronesian Yap islands' 12-foot stone \"coins\" to today's paper currencies backed only by fiat, Nobel-laureate economist Friedman ( Free to Choose ) here examines anomalies of world monetary history, including the effect of successive 19th-century gold ore discoveries and refining improvements on U.S. and British tender. He traces American currency's long, contentious gold-silver bimetalist saga, marked by the so-called Congressional coinage \"crime of 1873\" and ending with William Jennings Bryan's unsuccessful \"Cross of Gold\" presidential campaign in 1896. Friedman cites harsh lessons from postwar hyperinflation in many countries and declares that Roosevelt's 1933 silver-buying program may have skewed China's silver-based economy toward eventual communism. Uncontrolled money growth is the cause of inflation, the author stresses, and only monetary reform, despite undesirable side effects like unemployment, can cure it. Abstruse, theoretical and chiefly for the initiate, the book recycles parts of earlier works by Friedman, who himself suggests here that the general reader might wish to skip a particularly challenging chapter.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

According to the author, they all shared the same philosophy of life, enouncing business principles in terms of moral precepts. Newton's bonds with Carrel and with the scientist's friend and partner in medical research, Lindbergh, were forged by their common interest in metaphysics. The narrative is studded with anecdotes about the nature of these men: Edison's assertion that his deafness was an asset; Ford's dictum that profit is essential to business vitality; Firestone's advocacy of Japanese-style \"consensus\" management; Carrel's expectation of encountering Aristotle after death; and Lindbergh's revulsion at the destruction wrought by aviation in WW II.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

The recipes are clearly written, with symbols used to designate the different steps. There is a complete variety of wine recipes, using berries, soft fruits, hard fruits, tropical fruits, dried fruits and, of course, fresh grapes. Some recipes are ambitious--one requires 90 pounds of Thompson Seedless table grapes, and the authors warn that a champagne recipe requires a great deal of dedication, practice, and technique.

They note further that some of the writers who portrayed ladylike women encountering ghosts at their doors were female breadwinners churning out stories to keep the wolves from theirs. Such authors as Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Elizabeth Gaskell and Charlotte Riddell anchored ghostly events in the still waters of domestic detail, provoking an eerie contrast, while others, like J. S.

The author (political science, Trinity Coll., Dublin) has assembled a collection of games he created over 20 years of teaching. Field-tested with students in five different countries, the games move the players from basic political quandaries (individual survival in a competitive environment) to more sophisticated ones (committee policy-making) to team-oriented activities based on traditional games like soccer that mimic the conflicts and motivations of nation-states. The author supplies the rules, suggests the materials needed (dice, cards, money, etc.), and offers words of encouragement, but the fun and learning are left to the players. Not simply to be read, these games work must be played to be appreciated, and anyone can play. Recommended for all public libraries.?Thomas J.

{"title": "Paul: A Critical Life", "content": " The foundations of many of the central doctrines of Christianity, such as original sin and justification by faith, can be traced to the letters of Paul of Tarsus. While the third-person historical narratives of the book of Acts describe Paul's dramatic conversion from the persecutor of the early followers of Jesus to tireless proselytizer for the Christian faith, his letters intimately reveal the psychological and spiritual complexities of Paul's character. Using historical and literary criticism, Murphy-O'Connor (The Holy Land) draws his account of Paul's life and work primarily from Paul's letters. After an opening section in which he establishes the chronology of Paul's life and ministry, the author then explores Paul's early life and religious training and its contribution to an understanding of his life and work. Murphy-O'Connor devotes the major portion of his study to an exploration of the ways in which Paul's life and theology intersect in his letters. Lucid prose and exhaustive coverage make this biography the standard by which future lives of Paul will be measured.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

{"title": "The Triumph of Vulgarity: Rock Music in the Mirror of Romanticism", "content": " This is a provocative, opinionated study about the origins of rock and about rock as an idea. The author sees rock as grounded in the ideology of the American Revolution and as an extension of 19th-century Romanticism. He finds rock foreshadowed in Shelley and in the pantheism of Whitman. At the same time, he dwells on the vulgarity of rock (and youth, democracy, and popular culture), though he admits rock brings intense pleasure to many. He considers rock devoid of logic and perceives the lyrics as \"trite, obscene, and idiotic.\" Nevertheless he has produced a logical critical study, which, for all its paradoxes, many will find valid and stimulating.

{"title": "Alfred I. du Pont: The Man and His Family", "content": " Family maverick Alfred I. du Pont (1864-1935), heir to a gunpowder fortune, created a scandal by marrying his cousin, a recent divorcee, in 1907. Ostracized by the clan, he subsequently brought slander suits against two relatives. His later marriage to a Virginia farmgirl also raised eyebrows. Edged out of control of the du Pont industrial empire after a 15-year legal battle, he moved to Florida and devoted his liquid assets to building up his adopted state during the Depression. His recognition that great privilege entails social responsibility echoed the thinking of great-great-grandfather Pierre Samuel du Pont (1739-1817), a liberal French politician who narrowly missed being guillotined and who later emigrated to the U.S. and helped his friend Thomas Jefferson acquire the Louisiana territory.

Despite its dictionary arrangement and the encyclopedic nature of many of its entries, this volume does not fit the mold of standard Bible dictionaries and encyclopedias, which focus primarily on the Bible and on means of understanding it in context. Unlike them, this companion aims to \"trace the Bible's ongoing significance in such areas as the arts, law, politics, and literature.\" Entries written by over 250 leading international scholars reflect the current state of biblical scholarship. Topics are generally well selected, though it is not clear why Mormonism and Christian Science are the only nontraditional Christian groups treated, nor why the Scofield Reference Bible is the only special edition of the Bible considered separately.

{"title": "Those Terrible Carpetbaggers: A Reinterpretation", "content": " In this well-written, authoritative book, Current continues his lifelong assault on the myth of the carpetbagger. By recounting the careers of ten of the most notorious carpetbagger politicians, he shows that no single personality type or political design marked the carpetbagger. Current's subjects are men moved by principle and compassion. They made political errors, etc., but overall they hardly fit the stereotype. Current's revisionist portrait reveals much about the complexities and meanness of Southern Reconstruction politics generally and suggests that the only thing terrible about the carpetbaggers was their reputation.

Japan was effectively disarmed by Article IX of its constitution, but the communist victory in China and fears of the spread of communism in the region resulted in policy debates within the U.S. government over the Japanese peace treaty, the intended role of Japan in East Asia (including the renewed question of rearmament and a proposed Japanese economic sphere of influence), and even the length of the Occupation. Ultimately, it was the Korean War which forced the resolution of these and related issues.

Insofar as the book discusses ethical theory, it is simplistic and uninteresting; the author encumbers himself and us by viewing various things as matters of having a right rather than of doing what is right .

{"title": "Cages to Jump Shots: Pro Basketball's Early Years", "content": " Peterson, author of Only the Ball Was White , triumphs again with this history of the hoop game from its origins in 1891 to 1954, when the 24-second shot clock was introduced. Even those who are not fans of the sport will delight in Peterson's accounts of early games featuring 40 players on each side and the wild fights to recover out-of-bounds balls which led to the setting up of wire or rope cages all around the court. The book offers sidelights on the game as it developed: the gradually increasing importance of players' height (many of the early pros weren't even 510), the influx of Jewish players during the Depression years and the rise of the Harlem Globetrotters to counter Jim Crow on the courts. Newspapers and magazines of the 1891-1910 era barely mentioned the sport, and Peterson has done admirable work in ferreting out information.

Using novels, letters, popular magazines, and cookbooks, the author demonstrates how the 19th-century cult of domesticity heightened the esteem accorded housewives. By contrast, industrialization, the growth of a consumer culture, and the emergence of professional experts in home economics transformed the nature of housework and led to its devaluation. By the 1920s, the factors to make the life of the housewife one of emptiness and dissatisfaction were already in place. For informed laypersons and scholars.

Stokes argues that Poland's Solidarity was a self-limiting movement that sought a partnership with government. A Rice University history professor, Stokes offers a devastating portrait of Romania's former megalomaniac dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, analyzes tensions between the new Czech and Slovak republics, and blames the former Yugoslavia's civil war on the narrow policies of Serbian and Croatian leaders. Eastern Europe's fitful transition from centralized planning to market mechanisms, he observes, is taking many forms, including the creation of thousands of interlocking directorates in Hungary and a new Polish regime's \"shock therapy.\" Stokes also surveys the region's volatile ethnopolitics, including anti-Semitism and racism.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

{"title": "Searching the Heart: Women, Men, and Romantic Love in Nineteenth-Century America", "content": " This eminently readable scholarly study draws on archival evidence from the love letters of more than 100 Americans to reveal that, however reserved their public behavior, middle-class couples of the Victorian era valued and sought emotional and physical intimacy in private. Lystra, assistant professor at California State University, unveils a world of sentiment shielded by an epistolary veil in which a couple could display their \"true\" selves while developing, testing and celebrating their shared commitment. According to her research, the ideal of romantic love served to blur gender roles as lovers strove for mutual sympathy. The author goes beyond letters to investigate the effect of romantic love on marriage, on sex roles in society and on American religious sensibilities. Readers will pore over the copious endnotes and the bibliography of medical and advice manuals of the period, which add interesting details to Lystra's account of the public and private spheres of Victorian sexuality.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Freehling's sweeping narrative traces national crises that led to secession: the Missiouri Compromise, the annexation of Texas, the Compromise Act of 1850, the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Such figures as Andrew Jackson, John C. Calhoun, Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln stride vigorously through these pages.

Using North Carolina as a case study, the authors see the ERA as a heavily loaded social symbol that catalyzed women and men into translating very personal definitions of sex and power into political action. The first half of their study details the history of the ERA in North Carolina, the scene of six intense ratification battles. The remainder is fiercely analytical, examining what the ERA meant to the three main parties in the drama--the feminists, the anti-ERA women, the male state legislators--and the dynamic interplay of individual feeling and public discourse.

{"title": "Apartheid's Reluctant Uncle: The United States and Southern Africa in the Early Cold War", "content": " In this thorough and incisive analysis, Borstelmann, who teaches history at Cornell University, shows how the United States' post-World War II policy hinged not on South Africa's 1948 establishment of apartheid but on the region's supply of weapons-grade uranium. President Harry Truman's advisers, the author writes, were both anti-communist and racially prejudiced; they helped block anti-colonial votes when the United Nations was established. Portugal's provision of an Azores airfield ensured American acceptance of its Southern African colonies. Linked by history and trade with Great Britain and thus also with the United States, South Africa supported the 1950 U.S. entry into the Korean War, thus blunting any potential criticism of its vigorous crackdown on domestic dissent. Because of its focus on anti-communism, the author argues cogently, the United States government engaged in little internal debate before making the morally questionable decision to help prop up apartheid.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Synthesizing other works, the author uses an international relations approach to illuminate the posture of each toward the other and to speculate about the consequences of their interaction. Although Smith explores many variables in explaining the relationship, he considers extrahemispheric actors fundamental, seeing the relationship as having traveled through three stages: imperial, Cold War, and uncertainty. He concludes that over time this relationship responded to prevailing international rules but that these rules are as yet undefined for the immediate future.

{"title": "Antietam: The Soldiers' Battle", "content": " Probably more raw material (letters, diaries, unit histories) about the Civil War battle of Antietam has been crammed into this volume than any other book on the subject. Unfortunately, the author, a Maryland high-school teacher, offers the barest minimum of analysis or interpretation. Presented in chronological order, these excerpts reduce the confrontation between Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and McClellan's Army of the Potomac on September 16-18, 1862, to a clotted mass of vignettes that provides vivid individual glimpses of the fighting but adds up to an unintentional exemplification of the \"fog of war.\" There are 72 maps of the action included, but the absence of a master map renders them all but useless.

This billion-dollar industry, they charge, injects entertainment into every aspect of life, blurring the boundaries between fact and fantasy. Indicting TV as a major villain, Mitroff and Bennis argue that long-range thinking on vital ethical issues has been replaced with repetitious, comforting platitudes that erode society's moral fabric.

{"title": "The Market Revolution: Jacksonian America, 1815-1846", "content": " In this major work, noted Jacksonian historian Sellers details the impact of capitalism on all aspects of U.S. development in the early 19th century. While some may denigrate his analysis as overly Marxist, its conclusions are logical and supportable. In particular the impact of the market on national character, which Sellers sees as an ongoing conflict of arminian and antimonian philosophies, may lead historians to reinterpretations of events and policies since the Jacksonian era. Sellers's scholarship is vast, but a reliance on secondary sources in social and cultural areas is disappointing. Nevertheless, his bibliographic essay is a goldmine of sources for those researching the period.

{"title": "Samuel Barber: The Composer and His Music", "content": " Eleven years after his death, the American composer Barber is the subject of a large-scale biography, the first since 1955 (Nathan Broder, Samuel Barber , LJ 12/15/54). Based on the author's Ph.D. dissertation, this exhaustively documented study makes extensive use of original sources, including correspondence, manuscripts, and interviews. Unfortunately, the material is quite poorly organized. The biographical narrative is constantly disrupted by lengthy, discursive discussions of Barber's compositions. Treating the \"life\" and \"works\" separately (cf. Eric W. White's Stravinsky: A Critical Survey , Greenwood, 1979, or Maynard Solomon's Beethoven , LJ 11/15/77) would have been much clearer and more user-friendly. Despite these major problems, this book is recommended for large music collections because it represents such thorough research.

{"title": "The Knowledge-Creating Company: How Japanese Companies Create the Dynamics of Innovation", "content": " This book addresses the generation-old question of why the Japanese are so successful in business. The authors, professors of management at Hitosubashi University, contend that Japanese firms are successful because they are innovative, that is, because they create new knowledge and use it to produce successful products and technologies. They identify two types of organizational knowledge: explicit knowledge, contained in procedures and manuals, and tacit knowledge, learned only by experience. U.S. managers tend to focus on explicit knowledge and stress approaches such as benchmarking, while the Japanese focus on tacit knowledge. Using corporate examples such as Honda, NEC, Nissan, 3M, and GE, the authors provide insights that reveal how to blend the best of both worlds. This scholarly volume is highly recommended not only for academics (especially in organizational theory) but also for readers doing business in and with Japan.?Joseph W.

Nigg, the author of several books on imaginary animals, has arranged this source book chronologically and divided it into four parts roughly corresponding to the classical, medieval, Renaissance, and modern periods of Western history, each prefaced by a brief introduction. From Homer's sirens to James Thurber's unicorn, over 100 writers, both familiar and obscure, contribute to the literary histories of beasts. Although similar to Malcolm South's Mythical and Fabulous Creatures (LJ 6/15/87), Nigg's book is more comprehensive, focusing on primary sources?poems, travelers' tales, the Bible, and fiction?rather than on scholarly essays.

{"title": "Robert Schumann: Herald of a &quot;New Poetic Age&quot;", "content": " Biographies of 19th-century composer Robert Schumann abound, but room should be made on library shelves for one more. Daverio (chair, musicology, Boston Univ. Sch. for the Arts) has written a scholarly but entertaining history of the quintessential Romantic composer. Drawing on diaries, travel notes, and household accounts, he portrays Schumann as a tragic figure who experienced euphoric periods of creativity and bouts of depression and despair. His father was an author and publisher, and as a young man, Schumann showed great promise as a writer. His marriage to Clara Wieck, a brilliant pianist; his years in a lunatic asylum; and his death at 46 from syphilis make compelling reading. Of even greater value is the way Daverio connects Schumann's largely autobiographical music to the events in his personal life as well as to his passion for literature.

{"title": "Selling God: American Religion in the Marketplace of Culture", "content": " Moore, a professor of history at Cornell University and the author of Religious Outsiders and the Making of Americans , sees paradoxical connections between religion and various forms of commercial entertainment. In a novel approach to explaining the American church-state separation that yet leaves \"religion a central component of the traditions of laicity,\" the author traces the \"commodification\" of religion from the Mormon social halls, musicals and theatrical performances of the 19th century to the televangelical empires of Jim Bakker, Pat Robertson and Jimmy Swaggart in the 20th. Moore looks at the application of skilled advertising techniques not only in contemporary electronic ministries but also in the mainline churches, which have made subtler adaptations to the pluralistic marketplace in such areas as fund-raising, for example. Thoughtful, nonpolemic and provocative, Moore's study is a significant contribution to the scholarship of American religious history.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Fischer's exhaustive research shows that Revere played an important role in pre-Revolutionary Boston that included, but was by no means limited to, his midnight ride. The author shows how Longfellow's poem deliberately distorted the facts in order to suit the political climate of the times; the real story surrounding Revere's role and the battles of Concord and Lexington is infinitely more interesting because it involves planning, courage, danger, suspense, and national destiny. This is exciting history, and Fischer adeptly paints it in stirring tones while giving background information on Revere and General Thomas Gage.

Traditional Western philosophy and philosophers are well represented from ancient times to the present, but one also finds pertinent figures in, and discussions of, Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The volume is strongest in its coverage of ancient, medieval, and Enlightenment thought, weakest in 20th-century thought. Written with authority (both authors are philosophy professors at the University of Texas, Austin), it is also engaging, with a conversational tone and a narrative line that draws the reader along.

{"title": "Contesting Castro: The United States and the Triumph of the Cuban Revolution", "content": " Paterson ( On Every Front: The Making of the Cold War ) reviews the uneasy course of Cuban-American relations during the insurrection against Fulgencio Batista, the development of U.S. government and private-sector ties with the Cuban dictator, and the growing resentment of the Cuban people during the 1950s over Washington's support of the repressive, corrupt and violent regime in Havana. In his well-documented study, the author describes Washington's attempts to block Fidel Castro's assumption of power as Batista fled into exile in December 1958. He also reveals the tenuous relationships among the Cuban rebels during the insurrectionary period. Paterson shows how Batista failed to marshal popular support and Castro won the propaganda war with the help of Herbert L. Matthews's New York Times articles, which advanced the image of Castro as a Robin Hood figure in a noble cause. In Paterson's view a Cuban-American detente is unlikely in the foreseeable future.

The book's running title, \"Tearing Asunder,\" is indicative of the caustic tone underlying his thorough academic documentation. Prompted by his personal experience, the author reviews the effects of doctrinal, canonical, and pastoral developments since Vatican II and the psychologization of the system in the United States. He concludes that the scales have tipped to favor annulment based on defective consent (which precludes the existence of a valid marriage) rather than the preservation of an inviolable marriage bond as was traditionally taught. This unique study on church marriage tribunals (not on marriage in the Catholic Church) offers a balancing conservative analysis the author hopes American canonists will heed.

{"title": "The Slum (Library of Latin America)", "content": " This enormously popular and influential Brazilian novel, first published n 1890, is a landmark work of accusatory naturalism whose energetic author (1857&#x96;1913) at his best deserves comparison with Balzac (a likely influence) and his exact contemporary Zola. The story concerns two obsessive love affairs and their disastrous consequences: that of (the amusingly named) Romao, an avaricious landowner who gives up everything (including his black mistress) to pursue a wealthy white woman, and that of (his tenants) the hulking, well-meaning Jeronimo and the mulatto spitfire Rita Bahiana, for whose sake he destroys several lives, including his own. Azevedo is a passionate, sometimes hortatory writer, who tends to overmanage and needlessly explain, but his portrayals of urban discontent, rampant materialism, and especially of restless souls shaped and driven by their desires have an immediacy and authority that transcend (while not quite eschewing) melodrama, and have aged remarkably well. --Copyright &#169; 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

Perez-Stable also describes how the Cuban leadership is dealing with the gradual breakdown of socialism and the economic problems that have arisen since the end of the Cold War. Even in the face of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the loss of Cuba's lifeline to Moscow, the author insists that Washington is intent on undermining future prospects for political stability in the island nation.

Now comes The Soul of Recovery: Uncovering the Spiritual Dimension in the Treatment of Addictions, a sweeping study that describes the role of spirituality in a number of treatment programs. What is special about this book is its broad ethnographic approach; author Christopher Ringwald traveled across the U.S. to seek out the stories of individuals from all walks of life who feel they have recovered from addiction through some kind of spiritual transformation. Ringwald also interviewed doctors, family members and counselors to understand more about the role spiritual belief can play in successful treatment programs.

{"title": "Shameful Flight: The Last Years of the British Empire in India", "content": " While Wolpert wisely starts five years prior to Britain's disengagement from India-with the fall of Singapore in February 1942 and the subsequent failure of the Cripps Mission-it nevertheless focuses on the tragic miscalculations of Lord Louis Mountbatten, the last viceroy of India. The author, a UCLA history professor and author of Gandhi's Passion, argues that Mountbatten's rushed and ill-informed separation plan, which involved partitioning Punjab and Bengal (a decision that resulted in an estimated 500,000 to 1 million deaths for those caught on the wrong side of the freshly-drawn borders), could scarcely have inflicted more harm upon the region. Though Wolpert's belief that the botched partition of British India is responsible for decades of violence is not an entirely pioneering theory, his account of the complex events surrounding the separation (and its bloody aftermath) makes for powerful reading and is accessible to non-specialists. India's growing economic might and profile in the West may bring in readers who would otherwise pass.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "World of Faith and Freedom: Why International Religious Liberty Is Vital to American National Security", "content": " A veteran in foreign affairs offers this lucid case against an American foreign policy that either ignores religion or sees it as an obstacle to human freedom. Farr suggests that American foreign policy is unduly limiting our capacity to defend ourselves by overlooking religion as a powerful influence on how nations act. He argues for a strong connection between religion and democracy, urging U.S. foreign policy makers to encourage Islamic and other religious leaders to use their own sacred texts to derive liberal norms that promote human dignity. Bright narrative spots, such as the story of a family persecuted in its native land for religion but now living and worshipping freely in the U.S., pepper a too lengthy history of the International Religious Freedom Act. About Islam, the author takes a prescriptive line, setting out concrete steps and arguments for training diplomats about religion. Although the conclusion is thin, one irony stands out: even as America has learned the religious ideology behind the 9/11 attacks, its strategy of promoting democracy has largely ignored the critical role religion must play if freedom is to endure.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "A Leap in the Dark: The Struggle to Create the American Republic", "content": " This deft account of the American struggle for independence dispels the aura of inevitability that usually surrounds such histories by beginning its narrative not on the verge of the Revolution but twenty years earlier. Ferling demonstrates how the thought of independence emerged only gradually out of the fight against unfair taxation and British indifference. The endless clashes with Colonial authorities turned cautious merchants and gentlemen farmers who thought of themselves as loyal British subjects into genuine revolutionaries. Still, a sense of uncertainty persisted well after the British surrender, and Ferling vividly evokes the political turmoil of the post-Revolutionary years.

{"title": "America's Four Gods: What We Say about God--and What That Says about Us", "content": " Using conclusions drawn from the Baylor Religion Survey first published in 2006, these two Baylor University professors expound on their thesis that Americans' view of God can be characterized as one of four basic types: authoritarian, benevolent, critical, and distant. By knowing which of the four types of God an American believes in, these scholars can predict that person's views on many of the pressing issues facing the country. As an antidote to the prevailing but simplistic dichotomy between religious and nonreligious Americans, this thesis is far more nuanced and satisfying. But it, too, has its limitations. It's not clear that people stick to one view their whole lives, and it doesn't fully account for the views of those who occupy middle ground, somewhere between a judgmental and forgiving God. Still, the fourfold God typology is a step toward better understanding how Americans regard morality, how they understand the presence of evil, and what meta-narrative they tell&nbsp;about their lives.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1700, North and South America had similar per capita income; today, per capita income in Latin America is 20 percent of U.S. figures and more than one-third of the population lives in poverty, a wealth disparity that many authors finger as leading to frequent political turmoil and a weakened rule of law. Most of the essays pit the \"Washington Consensus\"-the 1990s effort to globalize-against the region's pesky penchant for electing populists, notably Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. Famous for his contention that civilization is moving inexorably toward capitalist liberal democracy, Fukuyama comes nowhere close to making such broad claims about Latin America's evolution here. He dismisses recent comprehensive explanations that take into account geography and technology, but this uneven collection adds little to the argument that Latin America's economic status the exception to the rule, rather than the United States'.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Flammable: Environmental Suffering in an Argentine Shantytown", "content": " Sociology professor Auyero (Poor People's Politics) and Argentinean anthropologist Swistun combine their divergent backgrounds and research skills to present this case study of Swistun's home, a crowded Buenos Aires shantytown called Flammable with a poor, highly polluted environment. Complicated by the false optimism they receive from the government, media and lawyers (\"having shit in your drinking water\" is good, lawyers say, \"because you can get a lot of money out of it\") residents understand contamination, but they \"interpret the information in different and sometimes contradictory ways.\" The authors see this \"social domination\" as the major instrument keeping residents from meaningful protest or organization; even residents aware that Shell Oil dumps toxic waste into their community are subtly re-informed by \"many misinterventions\" that obscure the source of the problem (are companies to blame, or the government? high-transmission electrical wires? poor personal health habits?). A powerful study of environmental abuse and \"toxic suffering,\" this will acquaint readers in a personal way with a troubling and too-common plight.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Unfinished Revolution: Coming of Age in a New Era of Gender, Work, and Family", "content": " Gerson (No Man's Land), a sociology professor at New York University, refers to those adults born after the women's movement of the 1970s as the children of the gender revolution. They are more likely than their predecessors to have experienced parents divorcing, a mother working outside the home, being raised by a single parent or living with a stepparent. How do such changes affect their expectations for intimate relationships? Gerson attempts to answer this question with life history interviews with 120 men and women living in the New York area. Although her nonrepresentative sample does not lend itself to statistical analysis, it provides a revealing look at a generation of reflective young adults struggling to construct a meaningful life in largely uncharted waters, uncertain, even skeptical, about the possibility of juggling career ambitions and romantic commitment. The author urges flexibility and forging innovative pathways. Even if the soft data is disappointing, the book is valuable for the abundance and candor of the testimony from this unmoored generation pioneering through radically altered conceptions of personal and professional life.(Dec.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Iraq Papers", "content": " This uneven compendium of primary sources on the Iraq War grew out of a course that the editors taught at Long Island University, where all are political science professors. The hundreds of documents&mdash;an eclectic selection ranging from official government documents to op-ed pieces, press releases and religious fatwas&mdash;are organized around the key analytical theme of preemptive war, and the editors introduce each chapter with an interpretive essay with a clear political bent: they roundly condemn Bush for cynically exploiting the tragedy of 9/11 and regard the invasion as a tactic to gain access to Iraq's oil, a move that has effectively destabilized international politics, brought chaos to the Persian Gulf, strengthened international terrorism, devastated Iraqi society, damaged the U.S. economy, threatened its democracy, and made the United States an international pariah. As rigorously as the authors make their case, their reluctance to seriously engage with dissenting views might ensure that the collection will find an appreciative audience only among the converted.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Early Modern Europe: An Oxford History", "content": " British historian Cameron, author of The European Reformation (Oxford Univ., 1991), joins ten prominent British and American historians in surveying the three centuries of European history from 1500 to 1800. Perhaps the most momentous period of European development, these years saw the fragmentation of the Christian Church, the European exploration and settlement of North and South America, the emergence of new forms of governance, and the rise of the nation state. While considering the broad cultural, religious, and political trends over the course of these three centuries, the authors also attempt to illustrate what daily life was like for the people of this period and how they felt and responded as their world changed around them. The authors succeed in illuminating one of the most eventful periods in European history. This work should be of interest to the general reader as well as to students.

{"title": "Marpingen: Apparitions of the Virgin Mary in Bismarckian Germany", "content": " In 1876, three eight-year-old German girls gathering berries in the woods claimed to have seen an apparition of the Virgin Mary in the village of Marpingen. Dubbed \"the German Lourdes,\" the solidly Catholic village attracted tens of thousands of pilgrims, many claiming miraculous cures from a nearby spring. Prussian authorities intervened with a military occupation, curfews, sometimes brutal policing and arrests, including the incarceration of the three girls, who were accused of deception but later released. Catholic clergy, alarmed by manifestations of popular religiousity, remained silent, while liberals viewed Marpingen as symptomatic of Catholics' superstition and disloyalty to Bismarck's Germany. In this engrossing study, exhaustively researched from German archives, Harvard history professor Blackbourn links the Marpingen visions to severe economic distress and persecution of Germany's Catholic minority. He also provides a social history of Marian apparitions from the French Revolution to the 1980s.

{"title": "Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean", "content": " With this volume, Freeman (The Ancient Greeks, Oxford Univ., 1996) has written a useful introduction to three significant ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean littoral. While some may question the inclusion of Egyptian civilization in a volume largely surveying classical civilization, the author persuasively presents Egypt and the ancient Near East as strong influences, if not precursors, of classical civilization. Although most recent volumes of the ancient world have been anthologies (e.g., The Oxford History of the Classical World, Oxford Univ., 1986), with different specialists responsible for contributing chapters, Freeman elected to consult various specialists in ancient history when composing his work but assumes sole responsibility for the final presentation. Acknowledging that ancient studies are not free of controversies, the author unfortunately does not feel that a survey volume of this type is the right forum in which to air them. Still, this work is a useful introduction to the ancient Mediterranean civilizations. Highly recommended for public and academic libraries.?Robert J.

{"title": "The Greeks (Rebuilding the Past)", "content": " Grade 5-7-- A commendable introductory analysis of the development of the culture, life, and customs of ancient Greece. Considerable attention is given to military practices and strategy of the various Greek and Persian armies and navies, and especially to those employed by Alexander the Great. Page layout is attractive with double columns of text and generous use of full-color photographs, illustrations, and maps. The text is clearly written and readable. Some sections are presented in the form of questions and answers between the author and a ficticious individual from that period who explains his way of life on a more personal level. This technique is informative and adds a humanized dimension to the text. There is no index, but the table of contents is adequate and the information is well organized. More emphasis is given on the early beginnings of Greek culture than is found in Life in Ancient Greece (Silver Burdett, 1986) by Pierre Miquel, and it has a more attractive format than Ancient Greece by Charles A.

{"title": "Was Jesus God?", "content": " Swinburne, British philosophy professor and the author of books on religious belief, the philosophy of mind and epistemology, explains the point of this book: to show that God conforms to specifically Christian definitions of God and that Christian doctrines and theology are true. By comparison with the author's earlierIs There a God?this book focuses particularly on the foundational Christian doctrine that Jesus was (and is) God. Swinburne uses the Nicene Creed as a road map, but the defining paradigm is God's love, particularly how God's love for us characterizes God and necessitates Jesus. Despite the sophistication of his argument, Swinburne depends on a sympathetic audience predisposed to his conclusions. For example, not everyone will agree that we exist in a state of original sinfulness from which we can only be reconciled to God by \"offering a perfect human life which might well... end in a death by execution.\" Although regular use of boldface words and phrases help direct readers through Swinburne's reasoning, many will find the academic language of philosophy daunting.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The American Catholic Revolution: How the Sixties Changed the Church Forever", "content": " This latest effort to digest the impact of the Second Vatican Council on Catholicism attempts to show that significant change did occur in the church in a way that is permanent and thus unlikely to be undone. Massa, professor of theology at New York's Jesuit-run Fordham University, dismisses the view ascribed to the late Pope John Paul II that Vatican II changed nothing essential in the belief and practice of the church. To say this, the author claims, is tantamount to trying to put the \"genie back into the bottle.\" He defends his position by citing the changes in worship that were introduced and, for the most part, warmly welcomed by Catholics, touching off a revolution that he says was felt in the widespread rejection of the message of Humanae Vitae, the 1968 papal encyclical on birth control, and in reforms in religious communities, and also in social activism on the part of Catholics. Although by no means a comprehensive examination, Massa's work is thoughtful and will be of special interest to students of Vatican II and the 1960s social revolution.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Global Grapevine: Why Rumors of Terrorism, Immigration, and Trade Matter", "content": " Fine (Whispers on the Color Line), John Evans professor of sociology at Northwestern, and Ellis, professor emeritus at Penn State, examine the rumors and legends that circulate about the risks of our interconnected world in their treatment of the most ancient source of news. The authors explore its influence in the intimidating global community of the 21st century, particularly in the arenas of terrorism, immigration, international trade, and tourism; they make a generally persuasive case that since rumor shapes how people think and then respond to the world, its propagation is a fundamentally political act. Relying on shards of evidence, bits and pieces of hearsay, the self-styled rumor scholars analyze an array of contemporary rumors and draw some unremarkable conclusions: e.g., Americans are of several minds about immigration, have mixed feelings about the exotic, and are anxious about the economic impact of international trade. Even if Fine and Ellis promise more than they deliver, there is much that adds to our understanding of rumor in an era when access to information (and misinformation) has never been faster or more constant.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War II", "content": " From 1941 to 1984, the United States achieved an amazing record of economic growth while witnessing the decline of its diplomacy and the fragmenting of its society. Author Chafe recounts the period in an exceptionally well-written study that bristles with telling anecdotes and quotations. His interpretation of events prior to 1968 is fairly routine but is supported with a sparkling density of statistical detail. However, after that signal date, his writing becomes more impressionistic and fails to fully account for the emergence of the New Right. The shift of traditionally liberal Jewish voters and the disaffection of blue-collar workers away from the left requires further research. For informed laypersons as well as scholars and specialists.

{"title": "A Life In School: What The Teacher Learned", "content": " In this memoir by Tompkins, a professor of English at Duke University, there is no mind-numbing explication of favorite educational theories or classroom practices. Instead, the reader is taken inside the author's emotional education, which had its early foundation in a compelling desire to please, especially through success in school. This shaping and rewarding of intellect, which also instilled fear, is shown to have affected Tompkins's approach to her life?the grind of graduate study, the politics of becoming a professor, even withdrawal from two marriages. Through a subsequent union, a blend of professional and emotional excitement and contentment, the missing ingredients of her personality appear to have materialized. Tompkins travels painfully twisting paths by which a scholar and literary critic (West of Everything: The Inner Life of Westerns) came to know herself outside the academic cloister with grace and humor as she challenges universities to conceive \"education less as training for a career than as the introduction to a life.\"Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

The first five chapters, we are told, require no knowledge of the subject; but for chapters six through 13 (the end), hold on to your hats. The \"garden\" metaphor in the title is only loosely stitched throughout the text, which is so well presented that popularizing constructions of this kind are unnecessary to keep the reader alongside the author's detailed, necessarily abstruse exposition. Topics covered include a history of particle physics, the Standard Theory, \"grand unification\" and beyond and the relation of particle physics to cosmology and astrophysics.

While medical and psychological research confirms the value of humor as therapy, Metcalf and Felible warn that conditions such as depression and drug and alcohol addictions must be controlled by other, more drastic means before the benefits of humor can be appreciated.

{"title": "Likeness and Presence: A History of the Image before the Era of Art", "content": " The icon, a representation of an early saint or religious personality, has a complex history. Belting, a professor of art history at the University of Munich who has authored several books on art history (e.g., Image & Its Public in the Middle Ages, Caratzas, 1989), focuses not on the art but the application and interpretation of the icon, offering a detailed examination of its use in early Christianity. The scholarship is excellent, but the book is not for the casual reader. The writing is complicated and difficult to follow, with an in-depth understanding of early Christian history assumed. The notes and appendix include pertinent quotes from medieval theologians. Recommended only for large academic libraries or special collections.

{"title": "Cultural Misunderstandings: The French-American Experience", "content": " Volk's translation evokes the flavor of Carroll's French in an entertaining, informative book. The author is a U.S. citizen of French origin, an anthropologist and teacher at Oberlin College, who lived on a Micronesian island and wrote Nokoru Stories , about social customs there. Her inter-cultural experiences form the text of this illustrative, often witty book about why the French and the Americanseven when fluent in both languagescan confound each other with what seems uncivil behavior. Carroll explains cultural misunderstandings on such diverse areas as party manners, child-rearing, privacy, using the telephone and, most important, friendship. The examples are eye-opening and all-encompassing, a vital source for learning how to establish amity not only between the U.S. and France but among all the world's nations.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"title": "Evolution As Entropy (Science and Its Conceptual Foundations series)", "content": " This serious and scholarly tome unites the theory of biological evolutioni.e., that biological systems tend to become more ordered and highly structured through evolutionary timewith the seemingly contradictory second law of thermodynamicsi.e., that disorder or entropy increases over time. The authors argue that , in fact, living systems exhibit growing complexity and self-organization as a result of increasing entropy. They support their difficult yet logical arguments with a wide range of examples taken from developmental biology, embryology, morphology, population genetics, systematics, and community ecology.

{"title": "Letters of Gustave Courbet", "content": " Containing all of Gustave Courbet's (1819-1877) known letters--more than 600--this massive volume explodes the notion of the artist as a naive provincial, an image he himself constructed and carefully nurtured. Full of pithy remarks, colorful descriptions and cultural allusions, the correspondence reveals the French realist painter as an ambitious self-promoter who craved material success and was keenly aware of the artist's precarious status in a market-driven economy. Among Courbet's correspondents were Baudelaire, Monet, Hugo and anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Reflecting his development from spoiled teenager to symbol of political resistance, these energetic, offhand letters express Courbet's defiance of authority in all forms, his hatred of imperialism, his tweaking of the art establishment, participation in the Paris Commune, tragic decline and his death in exile in Switzerland. Chu, an art history professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, accompanies the letters with 40 halftones.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Bernini: Flights of Love, the Art of Devotion", "content": " In the later years of his stellar career, Bernini created three masterpieces that exemplify the spirit of the Baroque style. The Fonseca and Albertoni chapels and the altar of Sant' Andrea al Quirinale vividly manifest the combinatory impulses that create a visceral, spiritual, and aesthetic unity out of the diverse components of architecture, painting, and sculpture. Careri's subtle study seeks not only to elucidate the nature of these dynamic ensembles but also to suggest means of investigating them. Of particular value is his attempt to evoke how the monuments might have been experienced and understood. In addition to his summary of essential art historical data about these works, the author, who is cultural attache for the Italian Cultural Institute in Paris, provides a thoughtful methodological critique of earlier studies. But for a sometimes strained theoretical garniture, Careri's attempt at interpretative comprehensiveness should command the respectful attention of the scholarly community.Robert Cahn, Fashion Inst. of Technology, New YorkCopyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

(Fill in the blank with sex, death, children, work, bodily functions, or whatever is appropriate.) Why study humor? Can we truly pare it down to basics and expect to retain the comedic element, whatever that is? Davis, sociologist and author (e.g, Smut: Erotic Reality/Obscene Ideology, LJ 3/1/83), argues that humor reveals universal truths about people and society. Citing comedians from Aristotle through Mark Twain and Groucho Marx to Steve Allen and Garry Shandling (and many in between), and tapping a range of good through breathlessly bad jokes, he attempts to illustrate the idea that \"comedy negates organization, structure, form, even clarity itself.\" Unfortunately, the general reader may skip the well-researched but dense explanatory notes and go right for the jokes, thus negating Davis's arguments.

{"title": "Making Gray Gold: Narratives of Nursing Home Care (Women in Culture and Society)", "content": " The author's sympathetic account of nursing-home residents and their caregivers is energized by his own experience as a certified nursing assistant in three Chicago nursing homes. In an environment shaped by profit-driven managers and government regulators and where kindness, common sense, and good humor are, unfortunately, not easily quantified and regulated, Diamond describes how residents and workers share common experiences of poverty, powerlessness, and regimentation.

Goff (economics, Western Kentucky Univ.), and Robert D. Tollison (economics, George Mason Univ.), cite numerous examples where victory and profit are the bottom line in big-time college sports. Hypothesizing that key NCAA enforcement committees have been controlled by schools with strong athletic programs, they argue that agreements reducing competition for recruits (inputs) and restrictions on the number of games played (outputs), have enabled the NCAA to obtain more durable return on its behavior than such notable cartels as OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Export Companies). Illicit payments to athletes and recent conference realignments are explained in light of the NCAA's cartel behavior.

{"title": "A Crime of Self-Defense: Bernhard Goetz and the Law on Trial", "content": " Those wanting a sensationalized account of the controversial case of Bernhard Goetz, who shot four young black men on a New York subway in 1984, are advised to look elsewhere. This study by a law professor at Columbia University is a measured examination of the case from its investigation to the sentencing of the defendant, with emphasis on the legal question involved. Fletcher supports the advocacy system used in American courtrooms and emphasizes its stress on reason in the law. He explains the law as it applies to self-defense: an attack must be imminent, the defender's response must be both necessary and proportional, and the defender must act with the intention of thwarting the attack. The author lays this groundwork carefully to show why the jury found Goetz innocent of the major charges against him. In the tradition of legal scholarship, Fletcher does not present his personal views on the case.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

By analyzing the works of authors such as Anatole Broyard, Norman Cousins, Audre Lorde, and Oliver Sacks, as well as the narratives of countless chronically ill, Frank evolves a theory that sick, or \"wounded,\" people tell their stories to make sense of their suffering and to find healing...thus becoming a \"moral witness\" in society.

Gaines, a former social worker and a devotee of rock music, began hanging out with local kids whose lives were much like those of the teenage suicides. Her reflections on the primacy of death in the culture of these nomads in a middle-class society are expressed in an earthy, colloquial style that marks the author's empathy with alienated youth.

{"title": "Parallel Worlds: An Anthropologist and a Writer Encounter Africa", "content": " In 1979 and 1980, anthropologist Gottlieb and her husband, Graham, a fiction writer, lived among the Beng people in a remote rain forest in the Ivory Coast. Alternating perspectives from each author, this sensitive, suspenseful and delicately textured narrative is a \"candid memoir of the couple's pain and joy.\" As Gottlieb queries villagers from her anthropologist's perspective, Graham sees a metaphor for their new life: \"a novel of manners written in a foreign language.\" But gaining the villagers' trust is difficult for Gottlieb; only after she fires her recalcitrant translator does she learn that the villagers had resolved not to reveal important matters. Ultimately, she finds a confidante, gains entree into Beng society and confronts unimagined rituals. Graham likens the village intrigues to the work of Garcia Marquez and even to the dynamics of American small towns; in retrospect he considers himself \"an ethnographer of my own imagination.\" Gottlieb and Graham teach, respectively, anthropology and creative writing at the University of Illinois.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"title": "Campus Life: Undergraduate Cultures from the End of the Eighteenth Century to the Present", "content": " When high school rebels embark upon college, they can pursue well-defined avenues of political or artistic expression, thanks to an alternative subculture available to American college freshmen since 1910, the author notes. The same is true for students who are more in the mainstreamthey can fall in step with a campus subculture that downplays academic work while glorifying social grace and athletic prowess. In addition to collegiate types and rebels, Horowitz, professor of history at the Univ. of Southern California, identifies a third subculture, that of the \"outsiders.\" For these intensely serious students, college is primarily a means to rise in the world. This comprehensive social history redefines the terrain of campus life, past and present. By grounding her schema in vivid history and anecdote, the author is able to tackle head-on a fraternity-bred tradition, still wide-spread, which devalues academic and intellectual achievement.

This book is intended for professional social scientists, counselors, and health professionals, while Robert T. Michael and others' Sex in America, just published by Little, Brown, anticipates a more general audience. Beginning with the theoretical foundations, rationale for, and design of the methodology, the authors put the work in historical context as they assert its accuracy and generalizations, urging caution about interpretation and implications of their sometimes surprising findings. Though the study was designed largely to \"fill significant gaps in our knowledge of sexual behavior associated with the acquisition of the AIDS virus,\" this book achieves a refreshingly readable examination of masturbation, sexually transmitted infections, cohabitation and marriage, fertility, and homosexuality.

Memory, Ladd points out, also extends to the urban landscape. The leaders of the new Berlin have begun massive architectural projects to restore the capital to its former greatness. To build this future, however, they must see the past. Can a new Berlin be built on the ruins of Hitler's bunker, asks the author? Ladd covers a number of architectural features in Berlin and the many political controversies arising from its past. For example, what should be done about the Berlin Wall?

{"title": "Hope Now: The 1980 Interviews", "content": " Sartreans, including Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre's longtime companion, were furious when these interviews between Sartre and his secretary, Levy, appeared in Le Nouvel Observateur a few months before Sartre's death in 1980, interviews whose authenticity Sartre confirmed. The critics claimed that Levy, a Maoist convert to orthodox Judaism, exploited Sartre's failing health, forcing him to abandon his leftist principles and to adopt a messianic Judaism. But in his introduction here, Sartre authority Ronald Aronson interprets the interviews as only another evolution in Sartre's philosophy. Just as Sartre had at first preached existentialism, then Marxism, here Sartre expresses belief in a political hope, replacing Marxism with ethics. Written in 1990, the commentary by Levy that precedes the interviews clarifies Sartre's philosophical evolution, and his concluding remarks further elucidate Sartre's and his views on freedom and death.

Rauch investigates the development of the culture of critical, liberal inquiry in which strong opinions are pitted against each other. He criticizes \"epistemological pacifists\" who \"think you can keep knowledge and get rid of pain,\" and deftly dissects convoluted \"hate speech\" regulations. But Rauch, unlike some First Amendment theorists, does not suggest ways to foster a culture richer in speech and inquiry; his long-term view--\"good criticism drives out bad\"--may not carry much weight with those who feel censorship has a role in fighting pressing societal inequities.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition."}

The packinghouse district, made famous by Upton Sinclair's The Jungle (1906), provides a case study in the evolution of an immigrant community over two generations. Originally fragmented by religion and ethnicity, people gradually were drawn together into ever-larger interest groups.

The ominous sense of a narrowly oppressive quest for power is captured in this startling field report by an anthropologist who was himself initiated into African sorcery. Stoller made five field trips to study the Songhay, proud, fierce subsistence farmers of Niger. Becoming an apprentice, then a practitioner of the black arts, he took part in one ritual attack that, he claims, paralyzed the face of the intended victim's sister. After hostile sorcerers' spells temporarily paralyzed the author's legs, he began carrying around protective charms. On his last field trip, he was joined by his coauthor wife, a sociologist; she adds a measure of objectivity to this firsthand account.

{"title": "New Day in Babylon: The Black Power Movement and American Culture, 1965-1975", "content": " To Van Deburg, the Black Power movement was not solely a political phenomenon that yielded minuscule gains for African Americans. It was \"essentially cultural,\" a \"collective thrust . . . toward racial pride, strength, and self-definition.\" Along with revolutionaries like the Black Panthers, community control activists and separatists, the movement included cultural nationalists such as Amiri Baraka (who later became a Marxist) and Maulana Ron Karenga. In fostering self-actualization, Black Power, in Van Deburg's telling, employed soul music, urban folktales, paintings, prison writings and comedy. Black novelists, playwrights and poets, rejecting definitions of aesthetic beauty they claimed were specific to whites, crafted \"alternative formulations that were far more relevant to black people,\" contends the author, a professor of Afro-American studies at the University of Wisconsin.

{"title": "Gone Primitive: Savage Intellects, Modern Lives", "content": " In this interesting and unique study, the author looks at the West's appropriation of the images, styles, and ideas of primitive cultures for its own--and, she asserts, miscalculated--benefit. Examining the West's concept of the primitive as understood through such sources as Edgar Rice Burroughs's Tarzan , the writings of Conrad and Lawrence, the theoretical work of Freud and Levi-Strauss, and the studies of a number of ethnographers/anthropologists, including Margaret Mead, she discovers an inaccurate, romanticized, often racist and sexist, and ultimately damaging series of ideas that have served to inform the West's concept of the primitive and to form the basis of its fascination. Although most of the author's suggestions for improving what she claims to be an unacceptable situation are so general and wide-ranging that they are practically cliches, the book provides a refreshing look at a topic that has not been previously examined in light of recent Western trends in art and culture.- Jessica Grim, Univ. of California Lib., BerkeleyCopyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Applying psychoanalytic techniques, Zonis, professor in the the University of Chicago's psychology department and business school, and an acquaintance of the late ruler, examines the Shah's lifelong fear of his father, his bristling disdain for women, his narcissism and grandiosity.

{"title": "How Italian Food Conquered the World", "content": " Mariani, author of The Encyclopedia of American Food &amp; Drink and the food and wine correspondent for Esquire magazine, makes a declarative statement in this fact-filled, entertaining history and substantiates it with hundreds of facts in this meaty history of the rise of Italian food culture around the globe. From Charles Dickens's journey through Italy in 1844 to 20th-century immigrants to America selling ice cream on the streets of New Orleans, Mariani constantly surprises the reader with little-known culinary anecdotes about Italy and its people, who have made pasta and pizza household dishes in the U.S. and beyond. Mariani's heavy emphasis on specific chefs and restaurant owners in the latter half of the book may tire your average reader, but foodies will delight as he details the rise and fall of French cuisine during the 1980s and '90s as trattorias eventually take the States by storm. Mariani includes many recipes throughout. (Mar.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.  All rights reserved."}

Leaders&mdash;in politics, the military and business&mdash;have failed to evolve with the times, say the authors, who identify 11 core elements of new (and effective) managers, including developing a strong ethical sense and honing listening and decision-making skills. The authors dedicate entire chapters to each of these elements and explore what it takes to shepherd nations, companies and families in times of crisis as well as how to nurture and train future leaders. Zinni's principles of governance&mdash;applicable to parents as well as presidents&mdash;touches everything from the Spitzer scandal to U.S. policies in the Middle East and dispenses practical guidelines with particular relevance and resonance.(Aug.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Both authors are professors of psychology and have meticulously and concisely boiled the plethora of material written on the subject of mentoring down to 50 key elements. The book seems overly geared to mentoring in a corporate setting, but anyone who is attempting this noble work--be it schoolteacher, big brother, or music pedagogue--will find useful advice here, which is not only turned outward toward encouraging proteges but also inward in a section titled \"Know Thyself as a Mentor: Matters of Integrity.\" The authors have left no stone unturned in their treatment, even dealing with the ever-present possibility of sexual attraction between mentor and protege.

Rockefeller shows how Dewey's evolving thought was closely related to the events and experiences in his life, and he interweaves both throughout the narrative, rather than considering them separately--a very effective strategy. Dewey's was a naturalistic theory of religious experience, rejecting belief in the supernatural. Aside from its value as a major study of Dewey's life and thought, this work has great value in showing how contemporary sensibilities which are persuaded by the natural-scientific worldview can, at the same time, maintain a religious orientation.- Leon H.

According to the author of this often humorous and sarcastic but cogently reasoned book, the answer, unfortunately, is ``Yes.'' Surveying a vast wasteland of American pop culture through a trail of such icons as professional wrestling, Madonna, Stephen King novels, and ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' Twitchell believes that the media has raised the ``low-brow'' to a level of respectability that excludes what used to be high brow from American life.

{"title": "Proust and the Sense of Time", "content": " A psychoanalyst and a major force in literary criticism since the publication in France of The Revolution in Poetic Lan guages in 1974 (Columbia Univ. Pr., 1984), Kristeva took up Proust for the University of Canterbury T.S. Eliot lectures in 1992. The result, presented here, is no unsettling \"reading against the text.\" She would be expected to find Proust's relationship with his mother crucial to the genesis and development of the narrative. Although Kristeva brings her authority to bear on a discussion of Proust's susceptibility to the second-level French Schopenhauerians and his resistance to Bergson, she acknowledges her indebtedness to Anne Henry's work in the early 1980s. Kristeva also argues that Proust must have found reinforcement for his insights into the unconscious and the links between image, idea, and sensation in Gabriel Tarde, whose manuscripts were entrusted to Proust's teacher and tutor Alphonse Darlu. Bann has produced a fine translation of this key for the beginning Proust student.- Marilyn Gaddis Rose, SUNY-BinghamtonCopyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Down the Asphalt Path", "content": " In this reworking of his Ph.D. dissertation, McShane ( Technology and Reform ) examines the relation between \"automobility\" and urbanization in America. He traces the history of city streets to show how automobile technology emerged in the U.S. when city residents began thinking of their streets as trafficways rather than open public spaces. He explores how the internal combustion engine finally took over those streets, a development that led to great leaps in suburbanization. The author then turns to the role of the car in popular culture, and suddenly his ponderous prose becomes positively sprightly as he shows how the automobile came to symbolize \"psychic liberation\" for American society. Even so, it is difficult to see how anyone not a specialist in urban history or civil engineering will want to wade through the first 124 pages.

Khalidi's research was greatly enhanced by his access to the family library in Jerusalem, bringing to light certain documentation for the first time. His historiographic method is path-breaking, including coverage of nonelite elements of Palestinian society involved in the development of a nationalistic sentiment.

{"title": "Bloomsbury Recalled", "content": " One of the last surviving members of the Bloomsbury circle, Bell, painter, sculptor and art critic, offers a disarmingly candid portrait gallery of major and peripheral Bloomsbury figures. His father, Clive Bell, married the author's mother, Vanessa Stephen (Virginia Woolf's sister) in 1907 but \"from 1916 Clive was hardly part of the family.\" He pursued love affairs while Vanessa, after a clandestine affair with art critic Roger Fry, lived openly with bisexual painter Duncan Grant, with whom she had a daughter, Angelica. Clive, Duncan and Vanessa were reunited under one roof in 1939, and the author conveys a sense of the emotional strain of growing up in \"a multi-parent family.\" Acclaimed biographer of his aunt, Virginia Woolf, Bell here defends her as a feminist and pacifist. Along with chapters on John Maynard Keynes, Ottoline Morrell and art historian/spy Anthony Blunt, there are glimpses of Lytton Strachey, novelist David Garnett (Angelica's husband) and Dame Ethel Smyth, who fell in love with Virginia Woolf.

{"title": "The Making of Intelligence", "content": " This title launches the publisher's new series, \"Maps of the Mind,\" which aims to offer \"a glimpse of the extraordinary innovations of science's last frontier.\" In fact, this title does the opposite, arguing that most of the so-called \"innovations\" in the study of intelligence, both human and animal, are extremely ephemeral. Beginning with a useful reminder that the very concept of intelligence is unclear, Richardson, honorary research fellow in the Centre for Human Development and Learning at the Open University (UK), moves on to argue that all IQ tests are highly culture-bound, that evolutionary pressures would result in a uniformity of intelligence among humans, not in greater variation, and that the popular \"computer model\" of intelligence is very limited. Instead, he argues, the concept of intelligence only has meaning in sociocultural contexts. This is a lot for a 200-page book to attempt, but the author does a very good job of providing useful correctives for a number of currently popular \"fads\" in the cognitive sciences in a concise, readable format.

{"title": "Stanford White: Decorator in Opulence and Dealer in Antiquities", "content": " What, other than some magnificent architecture and a scandalous society affair ending in murder, is New Yorker Stanford White to be remembered for? According to University of Delaware professor and author (American Art: History and Culture,1993, for one) Craven, no little talent in the arena of interior design. With much attention to White's European contacts and photographic and written chronicles of the architecture's interior work, Craven documents, some laboriously, the creativity and degree to which White festooned his clients' mansions. The introduction sets the stage for the burgeoning nineteenth- and twentieth-century trade in antiquities: destitute nobles, poorly enforced European laws, and demand for opulent houses from the likes of the Astors, Vanderbilts, and Whitneys, among others. Revealing sources, monies expended, and the decorating innovation behind America's Gilded Age \"castles,\" the author does an admirable job in showcasing not only the talents of White but also the rise of interior design as a profession.Barbara JacobsCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

{"title": "China's Search for Security", "content": " Nathan (political science, Columbia Univ.) and Ross (political science, Boston Coll.) aim here to define China's strategic motives in its foreign policy. They assert that China's foreign relations are based on realist principles and that U.S. misperceptions of Chinese behavior stem from ignorance about China's security concerns. The authors first deal with China's historic relations with specific countries and blocs, including Russia, the United States, and Japan. They then tackle such issues as military power, economics, territorial integrity (vis-a-vis Taiwan and Hong Kong), and China's security and the world order. The chapter on territorial integrity focuses mostly on Taiwan and, as a result, the following chapter on the foreign policy of Taiwan is redundant.

{"title": "Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method (Illini Books)", "content": " To put some of the adventure back in everyday science, this study is the place to start. Bauer, chemistry professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, upends current contentions about science literacy in a small, dense book that could be the nucleus of a restructuring of how science works in our culture, or, in the author's terms, how its reputation works. The call for more science literacy is a shibboleth in this STS-based (science, technology, society) exposition, which is a sort of deconstruction of the general image of science. Excising popular fallacies, Bauer argues that science is particular knowledge embedded in its time's social context and, therefore, in continuous change. His critique is radical: demystify the science we learn as fact (\"textbook science\"), keep \"frontier science\" (research) from being overwhelmed by structural forces in technocracy, avoid \"scientism\" as a basis of social policy.

The son of the founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith III at first resisted succeeding his father as leader and prophet but, as his biographer underscores, his governance from 1860 until his death in 1914 was fiercely committed to the religious legacy of his parent. Differing in style from the elder Smith's \"sometimes disastrous impracticality,\" his son exemplified rugged individualism with a secular pragmatism that sprang from his legal education. An opponent of polygamy, as proclaimed by Brigham Young, the younger Smith established a viable bureaucracy and a style of leadership that characterizes the Mormon community today, notes the author, a military historian.

Historically, domestic violence has stemmed not only from sexual inequality, the author finds, but also from individual aspirations and a familial power struggle that reflects changing social values, economic pressures and relations between classes, sexes and generations. Gordon notes that caseworkers handle many kinds of child abuse and neglect by both men and women as well as incest and wife beating. Their response is influenced by varying psychological and social interpretations and by dominant political moods. Several reform movements, notably feminism, have increased public awareness of family violence, especially as concerns battered wives. The book concludes, however, that all forms of abuse are still common, particularly the victimizing of children who cannot seek aid on their own.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Musa's verse translation is accurate but flattens Dante's poetry and diction; the translations of Ciardi, Mandelbaum, and, more recently, Robert Pinsky (LJ 11/1/93) are more satisfying as poetry. Furthermore, Musa's version does not include the original Italian. Of greater value are the author's detailed textual notes, bibliography of recent work on the Inferno, and collection of critical essays by the leading Dante scholars: Lawrence Baldassaro, Guy Raffa, Denise Heilbronn-Gaines, Amilcare Inannucci, Christopher Kleinhenz, Robert Hollander, Ricardo Quinones, Joan Ferrante, and John Welle.

{"title": "Choreography &amp; Narrative: Ballet's Staging of Story and Desire", "content": " An impressive work of scholarship, this elegantly staged study by the author of Reading Dancing: Bodies and Subjects in Contemporary Dance (Univ. of California, 1986) \"uses the concept of a culturally constructed, historically specific body to cut across disciplinary boundaries such as those of medical history, physical education, the practices of fashion, etiquette and comportment, and the science and art of representing the passions in order to elucidate pervasive values toward the body and the changes in these values over time.\" Using 18th-century Paris as a focal point, Foster casts her eye over the dance conventions and innovations of that time through early 19th-century romanticism. Descriptions and analyses of specific ballets are offered as interludes between the main chapters of the study. Copious notes and a formidable bibliography of general and primary sources complete the presentation.

{"title": "Vernacular Architecture (Material Culture)", "content": " An alternative title for Glassie's book might well be \"A Thoughtful Ramble Through Euro-American Cultural History Using Old Buildings as a Starting Point.\" Rewriting and revising the fifth chapter of his recent Material Culture, Glassie discusses the complex ways humans organize their lives by analyzing the houses they build. The emphasis is on rural building in Ireland, Turkey, and the Eastern United States, although homes in Japan, Sweden, and Bangladesh are presented as well. The photos and drawings by the author are exceptional in both artistic and technical quality. Despite the inclusive title, this is not a far-ranging guide or overview but an interesting tour of Glassie's mildly Marxian analysis of changes in peasant village structure and land ownership in the northern reaches of Europe and the subsequent effect those changes had on house styles in New England and the Middle Atlantic States.Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis", "content": " This extensive work, a comprehensive and detailed study of the city of Indianapolis and its immediate environs, examines the culture, history, economics, and significant personalities of this industrial hub, which grew in importance to the nation throughout its history. In traditional alphabetical arrangement, over 2200 signed articles (with primary sources frequently cited as well) give the user a variety and depth of information that might well become the model for other such efforts. Little-known facts spice the volume, such as John Muir's choosing Indianapolis as his home owing to its hardwood forests. The unfortunate lack of cross references and the placement of entries under arguable alphabetical choices (e.g., music, 19th century; classical music) compromise the quick-reference value of this work, but these drawbacks are easily balanced by the breadth and authority of the articles.

Why do Jews speak Hebrew? Why do the inhabitants of Israel speak Hebrew and not Jewish? In the last 150 years, many scholarly efforts have been devoted to this complex topic. Sternberg, a professor at Tel Aviv University and author of the Poetics of Biblical Narrative (Indiana Univ., 1987), now makes a significant contribution with this weighty volume. An excellent index, notes, and an extensive bibliography help the reader navigate.

French author and professor of economics Cohen (Globalization and Its Enemies) has a surprisingly easy-to-read style, as in a statement from the conclusion: \"we can interpret industrial society as an asymmetric marriage between highly endowed people (engineers) and less well-endowed ones (workers). The engineers gain from this arrangement if the workers are 'nice.'\" He has impressive knowledge of how each country affects many others, demonstrated in his refusal to speak in generalizations or platitudes: \"To speak of a single European social model covering the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and France makes virtually no sense.\" It's that careful detail in considering each separate economy that makes this book a small but substantial gem, especially in the standout piece \"The New World Order,\" which cagily explores the nineteenth century's \"first globalization\" in order to explain \"the new international division of labor.\" This slim volume will make an important addition to any economics buff's personal or professional library.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But, he argues, such a system must have firmly established limits to prevent its unwarranted use against American citizens. While supporting the battle against the Taliban, Heymann is less enthusiastic about subsequent policy decisions by the Bush administration, accusing it of ignoring the long-term consequences of actions that run counter to democratic principles and erode America's moral authority in the international community. The legal and political analysis is sound though dry and academic, suited more for policy experts than general readers.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "The Architecture of Western Gardens: A Design History from the Renaissance to the Present Day", "content": " Could it be that the expulsion from the Garden of Eden left humankind eternally searching to re-create the lost place? In these 70 essays the learned authors seek to identify and explain this quest from the Renaissance to the present: to define and explore the relationship of nature and society, culture and creativity, labor and diversion within the framework of garden design and use. Chronologically ordered, the detailed sections offer a historical perspective followed by specific examples of gardens as a reflection of society, either as images of its tastes or visions of its aspirations. The illustrations, including many archival drawings, provide access to the precision of garden planning as well as a glimpse of actual gardens. There are short bibliographies after each essay, but no overall reference guide; the diversity of theme may make this impossible.

{"title": "Debating the Good Society: A Quest to Bridge America's Moral Divide", "content": " NPR host Schmookler (The Parable of the Tribes: The Problem of Power in Social Evolution, SUNY, 1995. 2d ed.) has cleverly created a fictional Internet discussion group as the means of presenting a vital topic: the good society. The participants take different positions on the sources of goodness and social order. On one side, the traditionalists argue that human nature is sinful and authority is imperative. On the other side are those who argue that humans are by nature good and will on their own form a good society. Anyone even minimally aware of the state of the world knows that the truth lies in between, and that is where Schmookler leads his audience. One's position here determines one's view of the function of law, authority, education, public policy, and more.

Critics have branded such projects artificial enclaves that turn city residents into tourists and favor corporate interests at the expense of the citizenry. The authors strongly disagree, arguing that downtown retail developments create jobs, promote economic development and reassert middle-class control over crumbling areas. They further contend that, given federal funding cutbacks, cities have no other pragmatic course than to make deals with coalitions of real estate developers and business interests. A book for specialists, the study is full of details on the financing and politics that undergird downtown rebuilding schemes.

{"title": "American Foundations: An Investigative History", "content": " Investigative journalist Dowie--author, most recently, ofLosing Ground: American Environmentalism at the Close of the Twentieth Century(1996)--turns his attention to organized philanthropy, a world at once highly visible and widely misunderstood. Dowie draws on academic literature, foundation archives, and more than 200 interviews with foundation officers, critics, and grant recipients in assessing the recent history of foundations and projecting the changes they face. In the face of crisis, Dowie suggests, organized philanthropy has been \"slow to see problems coming, slow to respond, and quick to justify every decision.\" Dowie applies a public perspective, analyzing how effectively foundations have contributed to public education, science, health care, the environment, the arts and humanities, and civil society. Government devolution is likely to make foundations even more powerful in the twenty-first century; Dowie urges that they need to adopt democratic reforms (like citizen trustees, grantee advisory boards, and strong social agendas) to justify their increased influence. The author's proposals may seem utopian, but his studies of specific foundations and their programs are fascinating.Mary CarrollCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

{"title": "Choices in Healing: Integrating the Best of Conventional and Complementary Approaches to Cancer", "content": " In this well-researched and thought-provoking look at cancer and its treatment, Lerner argues that several alternative options hold promise and should be further explored. The author, a MacArthur Prize Fellowship recipient who has served as a special consultant to the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment for a study of alternative therapies, notes that the reasons why such alternatives are sometimes not taken seriously are as often the fault of their practitioners as of the establishment bureaucrats who categorically consider them quackery. He evaluates complementary programs--spiritual, psychological, nutritional, pharmaceutical--and also describes unconventional approaches in Japan, Germany, India, Great Britain and Canada. Make no mistake: Lerner does not advise forsaking conventional for alternative treatment. In fact, he believes that people with cancer should be under the care of an oncologist.

{"title": "Technology in World Civilization: A Thousand-Year History", "content": " Pacey, a physicist turned historian, traces the myriad crucial ways by which Western technology benefited from a continuous dialogue wth Chinese, Indian and Islamic civiizations. These cultures' innovations in hydraulic engineering, the smelting of iron, the invention of guns and gunpowder, in shipbuilding, printing and the weaving of textiles all strongly influenced Western technological development. In A.D. 1100 China was the most technologically advanced region in the world. What eventually gave the West a decisive edge, notes Pacey, was the development of disciplined factory production and the organization of knowledge according to general scientific principles. The author argues that Western science today often arrogantly ignores the constraints of local conditions in the Third World, which causes great harm: e.g., preventing African herdsmen from burning grasslands, a means of controlling the sleeping sickness-carrying tsetse flies that breed there. The book is packed with information, and readers interested in technology will want to add it to their bookshelves.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

In 1978, he published the first edition of this work, a skill-development classic that documents how he taught himself to play jazz piano. The premise of that edition, as well as this update, is that the author's hands, apart from his conscious direction, learned to improvise jazz: \"I sing with my fingers, so to speak, and only so to speak, for there's a new being, my body, and it is this being (here too, so to speak) that sings.\" This new version represents Sudnow's attempt to reach a broader, less academic audience with his findings.

It was originally commissioned by Doubleday, but Wiener returned their $500 advance and subsequently turned his attention to other works. Although Invention has interesting sections, it rambles in parts and has a preachy tone in others.

The author succeeds in casting doubt on the official version of that event and in posing troubling, unanswered questions. But, as is often the case with works on this subject, some of Melanson's conclusions seem as implausible as the Warren Commission findings he disputes.

{"title": "The Case for Legalizing Drugs", "content": " \"Drugs do not threaten the American way of life; they are part of it,\" avers historian Miller ( Truman ) as he makes a compelling case for declaring all drugs legal. The author wants the manufacture, distribution, sale, purchase, possession and use of drugs such as heroin, cocaine, marijuana and LSD legalized, with government price controls enforced to keep the costs low, if need be. The goal of a drug-free America, he argues, is an impossible one; thus, the anti-drug war is an anti-people war especially punishing to the nation's youth and to African-Americans. Further, Miller claims, the battle harms American democracy by, in effect, condemning users as subhuman outcasts (he even draws analogies here with the anti-Jewish rampage of the Nazis in the 1930s). Turning conventional attitudes upside down, Miller's book offers rich food for thought--and for argument.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Lone Wolf: The Life and Death of U-Boat Ace Werner Henke", "content": " In this scholarly study, Mulligan, an archivist at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., offers fresh insights into the Battle of the Atlantic through the story of a U-boat service that would ultimately lose three quarters of its men, and a portrait of one its most successful and controversial commanders. In 20 months as captain of U-515 Werner Henke sank or crippled 26 allied ships. Impetuous and self-willed, he was constantly at odds with Nazi authorities. This behavior, shows the author, reflected not principled resistance, but intolerance for rear-echelon heroes. When U-515 was captured by the U.S. and Henke was sent to an interrogation center, he rushed the camp's fence and was shot and killed. Partly motivated by fear of being tried as a war criminal, Henke, concludes Mulligan, was also a product of Nazi conditioning, which emphasized the duty to choose death when hope of victory was gone. His story stands as a paradigm for the fate of countless others during warfare.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Shakespeare--Who Was He?: The Oxford Challenge to the Bard of Avon", "content": " The great literary mystery will simply not go away: Were the plays and poems attributed to Will Shakspear, the glover's son from Stratford-upon-Avon, really written by Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford? Those who have never seriously investigated the question may be astonished at how compelling a case can be made for Oxford as the true author. Particularly striking is how events in Oxford's life parallel events in the plays, notably Hamlet and All's Well That Ends Well. The weakest part of the Oxfordian case is the testimony in the First Folio that appears to point unmistakably to the Stratford man. The attempts by Whalen, who is the president of the Oxford Shakespeare Society, to explain this away seem labored and unconvincing. But, on the whole, the general reader is well served by Whalen's presentation of both sides of the argument.

Davis contends that in the New Left Counter-Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO) used by the FBI, the bureau went far beyond gathering information and pursued secret actions against groups and individuals that weakened the antiwar movement. Along the way, the FBI \"circumvented First and Fourth Amendment guarantees and thus exceeded its authority.\" To support his claim, Davis draws on hundreds of FBI documents.

In tracing Euro-American relations with Indians from the \"discovery\" of the New World to the present day, the authors demonstrate that legal and political definitions of Indian sovereignty and rights have been, and still are, incoherent and inconsiderate. As a result, the brief mentions of Indians in the U.S. Constitution have not been adequately defined in legal or moral terms, and no one has considered how current Indian nations fit into the American constitutional framework.

{"title": "Northwest Lands, Northwest Peoples: Readings in Environmental History (Columbia Northwest Classics)", "content": " These 24 essays, drawn from a symposium on Northwest environmental history held in Pullman, WA, in August 1996, address questions of how humans have adapted to and modified the environment of the Pacific Northwest. Contributors include historians, anthropologists, ethnoecologists, geographers, biologists, law professors, and well-known names such as Dan Flores, William Dietrich, William L. Land, and William G. Robbins. The interdisciplinary essays are divided in six sections introduced by a brief synopsis, which summarizes the authors' main points and places them in the context of the Pacific Northwest's bioregional history. The multiple points of view provoke questions and analytical thinking. Recommended for libraries with regional and environmental history collections.-Patricia Ann Owens, Wabash Valley Coll., Mt.

{"title": "Along the Silk Road (Asian Art and Culture)", "content": " The famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma started the Silk Road Project in 1998 to further cultural study of a swathe of countries from Japan to France that lie along the old trade routes across Asia, which facilitated the exchange of goods like silk and spices. Also exchanged were ideas governing disparate facets of culture, like music, art, and philosophy. This book was assembled to accompany various festivals, concerts, films, and CDs associated with the project. Seven illustrated chapters by seven authors cover the history of Iranian cinema, the textiles of Central Asia, metalworking technology transfer, astrology, sacred sites of the Silk Road, the music of China, and a conversation with Ma. The material is fascinating, and the presentation is clear and accessible to nonscholars, but unfortunately no framework is provided; the only links are geographical. A further discussion of cultural connections would have been welcome, but the beautiful illustrations do hint at a rich cultural heritage.

{"title": "Rooms: Design and Decoration", "content": " Henderson, a journalist and book author ( Paris Embassy Cookbook ), here offers an extended paean to the Egyptian-born, Oxford-educated interior designer who has created many sumptuous environments in and out of Europe. (Among them was the redecorated ballroom, featured in these pages, of the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., then occupied by the author and her husband, British ambassador to the U.S.) Discussing suites of rooms designed by Stefanidis, and then examining each room in detail, the author indulges a fondness for effusive commentary (e.g., the designer is compared with Tolstoy) that strains her credibility. Grounds for praise are evident in Stefanidis's aristocratic interiors, which typically evoke a ravishing world of hushed European hauteur. (Some, orchestrated with upscale \"simplicity,\" are perhaps more beautiful still.) But because Henderson does not reckon objectively with his esthetic, she does not serve the designer's best interests, or ours.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Edited by Bloom, a University of Connecticut professor, this suspenseful account is intended to explain the author's conduct to her children. She recalls that, separated by the war from her husband (who was later killed), she fell in love with a fellow internee, bore his child and cared for her clandestine family, which included her own four-year-old son as well as the infant daughter, for three years under brutal conditions, fighting starvation and disease and braving disapproval and hostility of many inmates.

He demonstrates that structural elements such as image, narrative, rhythm, and trope are used to shape meaning, which \"is essentially constructed of feeling.\" Scheub repeatedly invokes the importance of emotion, believing it to be \"the essential component in story.\" He maintains that everyone can generally agree on the surface meaning and the moral of a story; what gives real meaning is individual interpretation, stirred by the emotion that each of us brings to the story.

{"title": "Habeas Codfish: Reflections on Food and the Law", "content": " The author of this meaty collection of essays about legal cases involving food is not only an attorney but also Chief Mustard Officer of Wisconsin's Mount Horeb Mustard Museum. His book, then, represents the melding of two passions, law and food. It's carefully presented, entertaining, and downright fascinating. Who would have thought food could play such a central role in so many legal battles? Although the book details plenty of cases involving food that was too hot or infested with inappropriate lifeforms, it also touches on some more complex issues. What, for instance, is the legal definition of a meal? Or, when the inventor of a particular dish sells the recipe to someone else but then decides to market the dish, who has the legal right to use the dish's famous name? There's also the story of a woman who sued a restaurant because it did not sell a breakfast advertised as \"available at participating stores.\" She sued for two-billion dollars.

{"title": "Keepers of the Wolves: The Early Years of Wolf Recovery in Wisconsin", "content": " Biologist Thiel points out in his introduction to this tale of the gray wolf's reclamation of its Midwestern range that this is a story with a happy ending. The last wolf seen in Wisconsin had been hit by a car in 1958, and the species was considered extinct in the state. Wolves still existed in the wilds of Minnesota and Michigan, and with the protection of the Endangered Species Act, it was only a matter of time until they recolonized Wisconsin. Thiel led a team of scientists studying the ecology and behavior of the wolves as their numbers grew in Wisconsin, they claimed new territory, and the politics surrounding the arrival of a predator heated up. We follow individual wolves as they are born, mate, and form new packs; and we share the author's joy of finding new wolves, his excitement of following them with radio collars, and his sadness when some of them are shot. Line drawings, maps, and graphs enliven this excellent look at fieldwork in the wilds of the Midwest.Nancy BentCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

{"title": "A Castle in the Backyard: The Dream of a House in France", "content": " Draine and Hinden (English, Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison) have charmingly recounted their past 15 summers establishing a summer home in the Dordogne valley in southwest France. With wonderful detail, they have created a colorful picture of their search for and purchase of an old stone house in the hilltop village of Castlenaud-la-Chapelle. Similar to Michael Korda's tale of relocation in Country Matters and Peter Mayle's best-selling A Year in Provence, this charming memoir brings to life the history, character, and beauty of the authors' new culture, their rural surroundings, and their quirky fellow villagers. The book includes a list of further readings for those interested in more information about the Dordogne valley, but after reading A Castle in the Backyard, you may not need the extra information it may feel as if you've already been to the south of France and loved it.

The viciousness of the Nazis, their humiliation of prisoners and the paradoxical cruelties and kindnesses paid by camp inmates to each other--all are familiar, if harrowing themes, in such memoirs.

External events and forces are important, but the account is centered on events within Cambodia. Furthermore, non-Communist activities receive much better attention than in Ben Kiernan's How Pol Pot Came to Power (Verso, 1985) or Craig Etcherson's Rise and Demise of Democratic Kampuchea ( LJ 7/84). Chandler's command of sources is superb, from the written documentation to the extensive use of interviews.

{"title": "What Johnny Shouldn&#146;t Read: Textbook Censorship in America", "content": " Wielding an influence far out of proportion to their numbers, according to the author, well-funded ultraconservative activists have used federal lawsuits and intimidation in an attempt to censor textbooks and to color elementary and secondary school education with their views on everything from minorities to nontraditional sex roles, gun control, evolution, holistic health, anti-pollution laws and religious tolerance. DelFattore argues that these fundamentalists target not only multiculturalism, globalism and environmentalism but also the right of students to think for themselves. Focusing on recent federal cases, her important study examines the chilling effect lawsuits exert on textbook content by prompting publishers to quietly practice self-censorship. A professor of English at the University of Delaware, DelFattore also criticizes \"politically correct extremists\" who, in her view, censor part of the truth in their efforts to eliminate sexism and racism from texts. Her lucid critique should serve as a rallying point for parents, teachers and administrators who oppose textbook censorship.

{"title": "Life and Terror in Stalin's Russia, 1934-1941", "content": " Stalin has had the reputation of ruling the U.S.S.R. with an iron fist, employing terror to inflict his will on a hapless populace. Accordingly, Stalin was also a paranoid monster who stage-managed the twists and turns of Soviet policy that made him supreme leader. In this strongly revisionist work, Thurston, associate professor of history at Miami University, tries to refute that conception, arguing that Stalin was largely reacting to events around him. The author goes so far as to claim that, though terror existed as part of the Soviet system, Stalin never meant it to be a primary instrument for ruling. Thurston has surveyed recently opened Soviet archival material and other sources and interpreted them his way, conjecturing that in the late 1930s-the period of the Great Terror-\"events spun out of... control,\" catching Stalin off-guard and forcing him to improvise. Whether one accepts what will surely be a highly controversial reassessment, the author acknowledges Stalin was nonetheless \"one of history's leading murderers, and his crimes were grotesque.\" Photos.

With deliberate steps the author (Forward into Battle, Presidio, 1992) studies the evolution of British infantry tactics from the slipshod techniques of the first half of the war to the tactically sound sustained offensive during the latter half. Using the Somme campaign of 1916 as a starting point, Griffith illustrates the effect new technology had on tactical thinking and the resulting new techniques of ground assault. He argues that many battles were carefully planned out using these techniques and technologies but that a breakout from trench warfare was not possible under the conditions of the time period.

This victimization of the Jewish community did not go unchallenged. The account of the conflict between Trent's prince-bishop, who wanted the canonization of the alleged child martyr, and the papal commissioner sent to investigate irregularities in the judicial procedures highlights the fraudulent nature of the charges.

Two political scientists provide a detailed examination of who knows what, how much, and why it matters in American politics. Employing survey data of Americans for a nearly 50-year period and utilizing sophisticated statistical techniques, Delli Carpini (Barnard Coll.) and Keeter (Virginia Commonwealth Univ.) find that, while Americans are not as knowledgeable as they should be, they are not completely ignorant of politics and that the level of political knowledge has remained virtually unchanged over 40 years. Among the authors' other major findings: women, African Americans, the poor, and the young tend to be less politically knowledgeable than the rest of the population; and people with higher levels of motivation and skills tend to be better educated about politics.

{"title": "Civic Ideals : Conflicting Visions of Citizenship in U.S. History (Yale Isps Series)", "content": " Smith (political science, Yale) presents a history of American citizenship from Colonial times to the present. His central theme is the conflict between the ascriptive and consensual approaches to defining civic identities. The former reflects the predominance of political and economic pressures in legislative decision making and judicial interpretation at the expense of the latter, a more humanistic approach where the natural, organic rights of the individual determine the rights of citizenship. Smith concedes that the bifurcated nature of these forces is unavoidable in an inherently political society like ours, and yet he chastises politicians and jurists for their inability to repudiate half the formula, thus weakening his argument. Smith's book is an excellent chronology of the people, parties, movements, and developments in this often ignored area of American legal history, and its value in filling this gap outweighs the author's tendency for critical commentary out of historical context.

Although many of the major themes appear to have been derived from Eban's earlier works, there is some updating of material.

In this first in-depth biography of Philip II, Kamen's understanding of and acquaintance with the sources is masterly. The author often disagrees with much of the classic beliefs about Philip's personality; for example, his supposed solemnity and predilection for black (Kamen notes that the king was rarely out of mourning). However, regarding Philip's reputed cruelty, Kamen says he was hard but \"restrained the severity of his officials on numberless occasions,\" yet he fails to enumerate these occasions. While Philip dominated Spanish politics and culture for more than half a century, Kamen devotes only a few tantalizing pages to the effects of that reign on subsequent events. The audience deserves more of Kamen's insights toward this end.

By adopting such a focus, the author makes his book accessible to readers who are not legal scholars. His focus is on the more conventional institutions and concepts of law within our society. He explores three stages of development of American law in the last century. In part one, he focuses on the old order, reflecting on how the legal profession related to the society through the business community, the criminal justice system, and racial and civil liberties issues of the times. Part two focuses on the New Deal era, reflecting a major shift in the law, which mirrored economic realities in the larger society. The same shift in the law influenced race relations and civil rights, as well as family law and family life.

{"title": "The Necessity of Experience", "content": " Reed (Encountering the World, Oxford Univ., 1996) indicts much of modern thought for ignoring everyday experience. Contrary to what Descartes and his many successors have argued, we are not trapped within our own minds. Quite the contrary, we interact directly with the real world, a vital truth that the pragmatists William James and John Dewey emphasized. In developing his case, Reed makes effective use of the ecological view of perception championed by psychologist James Gibson. For the author, the direct nature of perception is not an arcane issue of epistemology. The position he champions has social implications. In particular, Reed thinks the division of labor cuts workers off from adequate contact with the world. Surprisingly, he does not make use of Dewey's Art as Experience.

From specific places like the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. (\"may be one of the few great architectural works anywhere whose approach is marked only by directional signs, not by a glimpse of the thing itself\") to discussion of individual architects (Saarinesen, Lloyd Wright, etc.), Goldberger is clear and direct throughout, occasionally addressing readers directly with questions and thought experiments (\"For the next few pages ... think only in terms of what a building looks like when you stand before it\") that help recreate the architectural thought process. Sometimes focused too narrowly on the author's own experience (breathlessly recounted memories of architectural epiphany can fall flat), Goldberger occasionally risks alienating readers who lack his enthusiasm. For students and fans of architecture, however, this makes an elegant but energetic tour of building design, aesthetics, construction and inspiration that should encourage new ways of viewing one's surroundings. 55 b & w illustrations.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Rage To Survive", "content": " Born to a 14-year-old mother and raised by surrogate parents, blues and R&B; star James started singing gospel in church at five, was discovered at 14 and had a rapid rise to fame. Nevertheless, her story is a disturbing saga of drug addiction, jail sentences for writing bad checks and stealing prescription drugs, involvements with the wrong men and anger at a disruptive and unstable mother who has refused to reveal who her daughter's father is. It's easy to see why James says she has been \"raging through life.\" She claims it's the rage that keeps her going. Now, at the age of 56, she reports she has kicked the drug habit, reached an understanding with her mother and settled down with her husband and children, letting off steam by dirt biking. Ritz, who has written biographies of Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson, spent two years traveling with James and listening to her talk about her life. Here he captures the craziness and the pain. Photos not seen by PW.

{"title": "How I Made A Hundred Movies In Hollywood And Never Lost A Dime", "content": " Independent filmmaker Corman ( The Beast ; The Little Shop of Horrors ) wrongly argues here that his is not \"one of the more significant careers in film history.\" Having helped launch directors Francis Ford Coppola, Peter Bogdanovich and Martin Scorsese, and actors Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern and Sylvester Stallone, he is certainly one of the motive forces in American movies today. In this revealing autobiography, written with the coauthor of Papa John , Corman tells amazing tales of shooting full-length films in mere days with budgets under $100,000, and states his conviction that cinema is a fusion of art and money--which explains, he believes, why Americans do it so well. This account of Corman's life and career includes reminiscences by those who have worked with him: performers, directors, assistant producers, writers.

Unlike most sitcom one-liners, Metzler's could actually knock you out. This trip down memory lane, via the author's past writing clips with updated introductions, provides an uncensored insider's view into the formative years of the contemporary rock scene. Overall, however, the history takes a backseat to Metzler's groundbreaking writing. His early album and concert reviews set the stage for countless copycat critics eager to steal Metzler's flare. (They're still trying.) Much like The Nick Tosches Reader (LJ 4/15/00), also published by Da Capo, this work is a chronicle of creative critique writing.

Morton captures both the elegant decadence of Emperor Franz Joseph's Vienna, and the potent spirits of those revolutionary thinkers who, all in Vienna at some time during the two years before the war, would blow away the past and create modernity. There were Stalin, Trotsky and Lenin; Freud and Jung; the glowering Hitler; Kafka, Wittgenstein and Karl Kraus; and a small band of Serb nationalists, one of whom fired the shot that catapulted Franz Joseph, Kaiser Wilhelm and Tsar Nicholas into a war they didn't want but couldn't prevent, and that reduced them to puppets.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Writing about his successes and disappointments, Groucho also criticizes associates and his three wives, including his first, the author's mother, as he reveals what Allen calls his \"sneering intelligence.\" He throws out quips that vividly recall his presence on stage: offering his daughter belated wishes for a happy birthday, he adds, \"If you have another one, let me know in advance.\" While Allen claims enduring love for her father, readers will suspect more ambivalence. Now in her 60s, she recalls her expulsion from Bennington College, her ongoing psychotherapy, her broken marriage and the alcoholism from which she began to recover during the year of her father's death.

{"title": "General John Buford", "content": " Longacre adds to his status as a leading authority on Civil War cavalry (The Cavalry at Gettysburg; Mounted Raids of the Civil War) with this definitive biography of one of its key leaders. John Buford graduated from West Point in 1848. Serving on the Western frontier, he decided that whether cavalry fought mounted or on foot in a given instance mattered less than using its speed and mobility to be in the right place at the right time. Buford applied that principle while commanding first a cavalry brigade, then a division, in the Army of the Potomac in 1862-1863. At Gettysburg, his eye for terrain determined the Union position, and his troopers held that position until the main army arrived. His death from typhoid prevented the further successes that would almost certainly have been his as a cavalry commander. This comprehensively researched, well-written volume merits recognition from Civil War students and military historians.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

{"title": "The Senator's Wife", "content": " Bestselling author Miller (The Good Mother;When I Was Gone) returns with a rich, emotionally urgent novel of two women at opposite stages of life who face parallel dilemmas. Meri, the young, sexy wife of a charismatic professor, occupies one wing of a New England house with her husband. An unexpected pregnancy forces her to reassess her marriage and her childhood of neglect. Delia, her elegant neighbor in the opposite wing, is the long-suffering wife of a notoriously philandering retired senator. The couple have stayed together for his career and still share an occasional, deeply intense tryst. The women's routines continue on either side of the wall that divides their homes, and the two begin to flit back and forth across the porch and into each others physical and psychological spaces. A steady tension builds to a bruising denouement. The clash, predicated on Delia's husband's compulsive behavior and on Meri's lack of boundaries, feels too preordained. But Miller's incisive portrait of the complex inner lives of her characters and her sharp manner of taking them through conflicts make for an intense read.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "On Truth", "content": " Frankfurt wrote the little bookOn Bullshit(2005) that became a surprise runaway best-seller. It focused on, as the title indicates, people \"who are attempting by what they say to manipulate the opinions and the attitudes of those to whom they speak.\" This sequel, equally brief, trenchant, and deeply thoughtful, is another extended essay, this one on a topic closely related to the first. Frankfurt takes the position that a \"deplorable mistake\" would be unleashed abroad if there should develop in today's world a widespread lack of caring for the \"value and importance\" of truth. He finds a disregard for truth \"endemic\" among publicists and politicians, but he has discovered a similar attitude growing among authors. Frankfurt works with a broad canvas here, averring, \"A society that is recklessly and persistently remiss in [supporting and encouraging truth] is bound to decline.\" Without an appreciation for truth, humans can not consider themselves--takepridein themselves--as rational animals, separate from other animals in that regard. The author is an emeritus professor of philosophy at Princeton, and despite its brevity, this provocative meditation is not light reading.Brad HooperCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

Harvey's superb second thriller to feature PI Michael Kelly (after 2007'sThe Chicago Way) has the ex-Chicago cop taking on what he thinks is a simple domestic violence case. But when he tails Johnny Woods, a fixer for the city's powerful mayor, to what turns out to be a grisly murder scene, Kelly realizes he's stumbled onto a scandal that began with the great Chicago Fire of 1871. Digging deeper, Kelly unearths what was once considered an urban legend: two of Chicago's most eminent families conspiring to eradicate Irish immigrants by burning down the city's slums. As more bodies pile up and he becomes romantically involved with a judge with secrets of her own, Kelly vows to expose the conspiracy, even if that means putting himself on the wrong side of the city's most powerful men. Harvey's plot twists in all the right places, and his noir-inspired dialogue crackles without sounding showy. Marlowe and Spade would readily welcome Michael Kelly into their fold.4-city author tour.

{"title": "Called Out of Darkness: A Spiritual Confession", "content": " When Anne Rice stopped crafting stories about vampires and began writing about Jesus, many of her fans were shocked. This autobiographical spiritual memoir provides an account of how the author rediscovered and fully embraced her Catholic faith after decades as a self-proclaimed atheist. Rice begins with her childhood in New Orleans, when she seriously considered entering a convent. As she grows into a young adult she delves into concerns about faith, God and the Catholic Church that lead her away from religion. The author finally reclaims her Catholic faith in the late 1990s, describing it as a movement toward total surrender to God. She writes beautifully about how through clouds of doubt and pain she finds clarity, realizing how much she loved God and desired to surrender her being, including her writing talent, to God. Covering such a large sequence of time and life events is not easy, and some of the author's transitions are a bit jarring. Fans of Rice's earlier works will enjoy discovering more about her life and fascinating journey of faith.(Oct. 7)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Gone-Away World", "content": " This unclassifiable debut from the son of legendary thriller author John le Carr&eacute; is simultaneously a cautionary tale about the absurdity of war; a sardonic science fiction romp through Armageddon; a conspiracy-fueled mystery replete with ninjas, mimes and cannibal dogs; and a horrifying glimpse of a Lovecraftian near-future. Go Away bombs have erased entire sections of reality from the face of the Earth. A nameless soldier and his heroic best friend witness firsthand the unimaginable aftermath outside the Livable Zone, finding that the world has unraveled and is home to an assortment of nightmarish mutations. With the fate of humankind in the balance, the pair become involved in an unlikely and potentially catastrophic love triangle. Readers who prefer linear, conventional plotlines may find Harkaway overly verbose and frustratingly tangential, but those intrigued by works that blur genre boundaries will find this wildly original hybrid a challenging and entertaining entry in the post-apocalyptic canon.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The versatile Khadra brings the reader inside the mind of an unnamed terrorist-to-be, an Iraqi Bedouin, radicalized by witnessing the death of innocents and the humiliation of the civilian population by the American forces in the Second Gulf War. Without apologizing for the carnage caused by either side in the conflict, the author, a former officer in the Algerian army, manages to make the thoughts of a suicide bomber accessible to a Western readership, even as the scope of the terrorist's intended target, meant to dwarf 9/11 in its impact, and the method's plausibility will send a shiver down the spine of most readers. Despite the essential bleakness of the book's themes, Khadra (The Swallows of Kabul;The Attack) manages to inject a note of hope toward the end, without betraying his powerful message of how the occupation of Iraq has brutalized both the Iraqis and the Americans.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "American Colossus: The Triumph of Capitalism, 1865-1900", "content": " In this timely study, University of Texas historian Brands (Traitor to His Class) describes the rise of the great corporate capitalists after the Civil War. J. Pierpont Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie constituted an trinity of power-obsessed individuals who instinctively understood that wealth was the ultimate political weapon. They defined the cold-blooded authority of big business. Fascinating detours away from the tale of corporate empires examine the Reconstruction process in the South, the Indian Wars of the West, the opening of the Great Plains, immigration in the East, and the rise of organized labor and the agrarian reformers. Effectively, excerpts from the first-person accounts of Booker T. Washington, Black Elk, Jacob Riis, and others convey the drama of the time. Perhaps the only significant omission in this fast-paced, engrossing narrative is a tendency to dwell on political doctrines that sought to repudiate or restrain capitalism while only briefly discussing the dogma of Herbert Spencer's social Darwinism,&nbsp;which favored the monopolists.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Cantor, who refuses to accept the police theory that Henrik killed himself, launches her own investigation. (The book's title refers to one of the mysteries surrounding the JFK assassination, which had become a bizarre metaphor for the secretive Henrik.) In her quest for answers, Cantor journeys to Australia in search of her estranged husband; to Barcelona, where Henrik had an apartment and a surprisingly large bank account; and to Maputo, Mozambique, where she learns of the devastation wrought by poverty, AIDS and greed. Mankell, author of the wonderful Kurt Wallender series (Faceless Killers, etc.), is a deft and imaginative plotter and an insightful observer of the human condition, but here his righteous anger over the AIDS crisis in Africa and the exploitative role of the pharmaceutical industry overshadows the mystery solving.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown", "content": " Though this blistering book identifies many causes of the recent financial crisis, from housing policy to minimum capital requirements for banks, the authors lay ultimate blame on a dominant deregulatory ideology and Wall Street's corresponding political influence. Johnson, professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, and Kwak, a former consultant for McKinsey, follow American finance's rocky road from the debate between Jefferson and Hamilton over the first Bank of the United States through frequent friction between Big Finance and democracy to the Obama administration's responses to the crises. The authors take a highly critical stance toward recent palliative measures, arguing that nationalization of the banks would have been preferable to the bailouts, which have allowed the banks to further consolidate power and resources. Given the swelling size of the six megabanks, the authors make a persuasive case that the financial system cannot be secure until those banks that are too big to fail are somehow broken up. This intelligent, nuanced book might be too technical for general-interest readers, but it synthesizes a significant amount of research while advancing a coherent and compelling point of view.(Apr.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the near future, U.S. president John Gutierrez goes straight from his inauguration to crisis management when his national security team informs him that he must focus his attention on Project Tangram, a secret government program to stave off an epidemic caused by alien parasites, which form itchy blue triangular patches on the skin. Victims eventually become paranoid and violent. As the infestation spreads, Gutierrez must decide whether the outbreak can be contained without the use of tactical nukes on American soil. Meanwhile, the creatures responsible for the parasites get a foothold in Michigan through a seven-year-old girl, who manifests possession by drawing blue triangles on her dolls. While lacking the psychological sophistication of Jack Finney'sThe Body Snatchersor David Gerrold's War Against the Chtorr series, this page-turner builds inexorably to an explosive ending.5-city author tour.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Complete Home Owner's Guidebook: Make the Most of Your Biggest Asset in Any Market", "content": " Crook, editor of theWall Street Journal Sunday, offers a clear, no-holds barred look at the pros and cons of owning a home&mdash;rather than renting one from a bank via a mortgage&mdash;along with its ultimate costs. The author debunks popularly held views about the wisdom of viewing a home as a piggybank and how that can easily lead to financial disappointment. Owning a home is essentially an expense, he contends, providing repeated proof that few home buyers build accessible wealth through home ownership except in bullish real estate markets. His advice on making the purchase decision, especially in a weak housing market, along with how and when to use debt to do so, are invaluable. For those aspiring to own a home and those trying to manage the affordability of their biggest asset, this is a must read. It is applicable to home buyers and owners of all economic backgrounds, and in any phase of their financial life from the newly employed to the retired.(Dec.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Actually, this work is about how women can change their approach to their partners, which means changing themselves first, thus improving their relationships. As a seminar leader and frequent visitor on the talk-show circuit, Weiner-Davis knows how to reach an audience. The best-selling author of Divorce Busting (Summit, 1992) and other works presents her ideas in a friendly and practical manner. Although some may balk at what appears, at first glance, to be manipulation, others will want to try Weiner-Davis's advice. Granted that the author may have oversimplified complex relationships, her ideas provide at least a starting point for women who are unhappy.

Frequently, the narrator begins in delight and wonder&mdash;a street is a circus; a beautiful lady stirs his heart&mdash;and ends in terror, doubt, and confusion.

Nicknamed \"Neutron Jack\" for his ruthless willingness to fire non-performers, Welch created a new culture at GE by transforming the criteria for executive performance so that management had to get to know their workers, which allowed them to choose future leaders to develop in a series of room-to-grow jobs. The authors offer suggestions for adopting Welch's methods for today's global environment, examining not only GE but also Novartis, Hindustan Unilever, and Proctor and Gamble to suggest that today's leaders need to manage multiple brands in one country, shepherd a single brand across the globe, and spend time working abroad.

Dex becomes a TV presenter whose life of sex, booze, and drugs spins out of control, while Em dully slogs her way through awful jobs before becoming the author of young adult books.

{"title": "The Silent Land", "content": " Near the outset of this gently haunting fantasy thriller from British author Joyce (Requiem), a freak avalanche buries Zoe and Jake, a couple on a skiing holiday near the Pyrenean resort town of Saint-Bernard-en-Haut. After digging out, they find themselves the only inhabitants of the unnaturally silent landscape. Back at their hotel, they discover they're still alone. All their efforts to leave for the next town only bring them back in a circle. Jake suspects that they've died&mdash;but then Zoe begins seeing furtive figures and hearing snatches of speech that suggest this likely explanation is more complex than it seems. Joyce brings freshness to this familiar supernatural scenario by emphasizing the humanness of his characters over the weirdness of the phenomena. By the time the tale sounds its final bittersweet note, readers will remember the passionate emotional bond the two have shared and self-sacrifices that are the hallmark of a love that can transcend death.

Sworn to secrecy, Crane is transported from the rig to an amazing undersea habitat run by the military that's apparently pursuing evidence that Atlantis exists. Psychotic episodes among the scientific staff as well as the activities of a saboteur that threatens the project's safety keep Crane busy, even as some of the staff members confront him with concerns that exploring the Earth's core could be fatal to all life on earth.

An anonymous plea for help sends Lydia and ex-FBI agent Jeffrey Mark, her lover and partner, to Miami to investigate the fate of young Tatiana Quinn, who has disappeared from her wealthy home where she lived with her stepfather Nathan Quinn and her Albanian mother. Miscione isn't afraid to think big, and her complicated plot throws her heroes into a case that involves Miami cops, the FBI, a cartel of immensely powerful and wealthy men, snuff films, girls sold into sexual slavery and plenty of enforcers. The action roils from New York to Miami, to Eastern Europe and back to New York with the body count steadily growing. The book's blend of glitz (the author drops brand names faster than you can say Dior), action and a strong female lead will appeal as long as readers are willing to forgive a plot that never begins to convince.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Editors M. Susan Burns, Peg Griffin and Catherine E. Snow present a thorough guide to building a strong framework for reading, beginning in infancy and continuing through grade three. In each section, the authors offer practical, hands-on activities to share with children that will ignite interest in reading and build skills. Along with the development of specific reading skills, such as phonological and phonemic awareness, the editors explain how new experiences help expand a child's vocabulary. In addition to recommending children's reading activities at home (such as compiling grocery lists, singing songs, telling stories and, of course, reading), the book describes goals that should be reached at various ages (a kindergartner, for instance, should notice when simple sentences don't make sense). In the final section, the editors reveal that most reading problems can be avoided or resolved in the early years and emphasize the importance of a reader-friendly home, day-care and school environment. Parents will find this a comprehensive resource, and it will be especially useful for teachers planning literacy-enhancing classroom activities.Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Then Paula gets a role in a famous Italian director's new movie. She promptly dumps Matt for the director, who brings his power and money to bear to ensure that Matt's custody fight for Maddie is almost hopeless.

{"title": "You Were Made for More: The Life You Have, the Life God Wants You to Have", "content": " Using the style of extemporaneous sermons, Cymbala, longtime pastor of the Brooklyn Tabernacle and author ofFresh Faith, brings a message of inspiration to readers. God, Cymbala says, wants more for Christians than rote religion or an empty life. The book is dotted with anecdotes of real people who overcame obstacles of poverty and drug addiction by a newfound commitment to Jesus; used their money and skills to support the church; or gave up the security of good jobs to serve others. As such, it will likely encourage some Christians facing life challenges. Although the associations often seem forced and the book's trajectory is unclear, Cymbala's use of biblical texts (particularly from Joshua, Judges and Ruth) serve their contemporary purpose. What the book lacks in unity, it makes up for in passion. Cymbala's confidence about defining the nature and wishes of God will not suit every reader, but his commitment to promoting generosity and well-being through the church yields gems of encouragement for people seeking stability and direction.(Aug. 31)\"\"Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When the interventionist is found dead and the teen is missing, mother Barbara Covington tries to find her daughter before police can arrest the girl for murder. Short chapters and terse dialogue propel the fast-paced action. It's competent genre work, though the characterizations could go deeper. The villain is somewhat improbable, and the 14-year-old brother of the missing teen is exceptionally clever and poised. But the mother-daughter relationship strikes true emotional notes; the redemptive arc of evangelical Christian fiction is natural and resonant in a story of addiction.

Burke believes our deepest longings are fulfilled through relationships with God and others, and he provides a way to create those relationships through a 60-day experiment in faith. He says that willingness is the key to staying connected to God at least once every 60 minutes for 60 days. His book offers a roadmap for the 60-60 Experiment through loving God, loving people, building character and demonstrating God's love to the world. Burke uses Bible texts and real-life examples liberally, as well as action steps with each chapter to make principles personal. He encourages accountability, yet eschews traditional groups that encourage participants to try harder because we can never become all that God intends just by trying harder. Connecting to God creates genuine change, he says. This is a thorough, well-written and challenging book.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Sacredness of Questioning Everything", "content": " Questions make new worlds possible, asserts author Dark (The Gospel According to America), a key premise in this thought-provoking meander of reflections on, and challenges for, living an engaged life of authentic Christianity.

Dark brings to his writing the kind of energy, offbeat enthusiasm and commitment to relevance that must make his high school English classes exciting places for inquiry and exploration. That each page yokes keen observation to practical application with wisdom and compassion inclines the reader to forgive the book's bewildering organization and abstruse section headings. Questions for further conversation at the end of each chapter will be useful for groups eager to put Dark's appeals into action.

Individual stories form prototypes: there is Rosaria, left for dead in a pile of bodies, who forgives her sisters killer. And Chantal, whose family is brutally murdered yet who forgives her neighbor for the crimes. Devota, mutilated and left for dead, survives, forgives and eventually adopts several orphans. Each story is horrible and deeply personal as Larson mines the truths of forgiveness deep in each ones tale. Helpful interludes offer readers hands-on ways to facilitate forgiveness and take the next step to reconciliation in their own lives. This isnt an easy book to read or digest, yet its message is mandatory: Forgiveness can push out the borders of what we believe is possible. Reconciliation can offer us a glimpse of the transfigured world to come.(Feb.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."}
{"title": "O Me of Little Faith: True Confessions of a Spiritual Weakling", "content": " Doubt can play an important role in a healthy spiritual life. This statement may seem counter-intuitive, but Boyett, popular speaker and author of Pocket Guide to the Afterlife, illustrates its truth through his own faith struggles. Grounded in Scripture and Christian history, the author provides examples of great religious thinkers who experienced their own trials of doubt about God, faith, and the church. But it is when he weaves in humorous, even poignant, autobiographical anecdotes that his writing springs to life. One fascinating highlight is the discussion regarding the \"hidden God,\" a phrase used by many great religious figures to describe just how different God is from human categories and understanding. Ultimately, the author's point is clear: if there were no doubt, there would not be faith. The author is comfortable with a snarky, self-deprecating style that will appeal to the under-40 crowd, although older readers may not appreciate it. For anyone wrestling with doubt about religious faith, however, this memoir provides a chance to examine the experience with levity. (May) (c)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.  All rights reserved."}
{"title": "The Dude Abides: The Gospel According to the Coen Brothers", "content": " It must be true that God can be found even in the quirkiest of places.Chicago Sun-Timesreligion journalist Falsani mined the 14 films (since 1984) of Joel and Ethan Coen to find God and to articulate their spiritual and religious questions and challenges. The Coen brothers have a reputation for injecting a lot of dark humor into their movies, but as the author illustrates, the comedy is an avenue to deeper issues. Death, betrayal, greed, the seeming absence of God and the dire consequences of one's choices are the complex themes expertly handled by the filmmakers. Falsani does not posit that these films are overtly religious, but she does successfully convey their spiritual insights about the human condition. Each chapter provides a movie plot summary and concludes with an insightful segment dubbed The Moral of the Story. Falsani is an expert at pop culture analysis and her love for the celluloid arts shines forth brightly&mdash;her interpretations are nuanced and sophisticated without being pretentious.

Herrick, a popular Christian speaker, finds it sadly ironic that the very words and pat phrases he offers to listening audiences aren't doing him much good in his personal sorrow. With the arrival of a letter and an invitation from an old friend, Herrick travels to a former haunted bed-and-breakfast and rejoins classmates from years earlier; during their gathering, they eventually expose their deepest longings and struggles. Keenly attentive to his own skewed view on life at present, Herrick finds himself strangely moved by his former friends' individual plights and begins to glimpse small slivers of hope in the cracks of brokenness. No matter how he tries to shut out the divinely orchestrated lessons, Herrick finally surrenders and what he discovers surprises him most of all. Finely tuned and sensitively written, this moving story reminds readers that everyone bleeds the same on the inside.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Crazy Good Sex: Putting to Bed the Myths Men Have about Sex", "content": " In the popular religious imagination, sex and God don&#xD6;t often mix. The latter is pure and holy and the former is associated with guilt and shame. Parrott, a clinical psychologist and author ofLove Talk, has counseled numerous couples about sexual matters. There is nothing puritanical about his treatment of sex and religion. God, he claims, meant for couples to make love; crazy good sex is a vital component to a successful marriage. This readable and user-friendly manual for men is not, however, an anything goes book. The author cautions that certain practices, such as viewing Internet pornography, can be harmful to a marriage. Men and women both will gain valuable insights into human sexuality and perhaps even spice up their love life.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Maverick War: Chennault and the Flying Tigers", "content": " The Flying Tigers was a sort of airborne flying foreign legion, credited with saving China from Japanese conquest early in World War II. This highly readable book traces its creation by Claire Chennault, a fiercely independent retired soldier appointed air adviser by Chiang Kai-shek, and its awesome accomplishments with a handful of rowdily aggressive pilots. The air battles are memorably described, but the surprise is Schultz's revelation of Chennault's battles with superiors and his often tenuous authority over his pilots (who were all civilians). Although something of a national idol in America during the war, Chennault was considered a troublemaker and nuisance by such generals as Joseph Stilwell, commander of Chinese nationalist forces, Henry Arnold, army air corps chief, and George Marshall, army chief of staff. One's sympathy is directed inevitably toward Chennault, who performed wonders at the end of a long and miserly supply line, his pilots consistently outfighting an enemy force that was grossly superior in numbers.

Meantime the priest's investigation pays off with facts about a long-buried crime and evidence against the guilty person.

Wladziu Valentino (\"Lee\") Liberace was considered a future concert pianist in his hometown, Milwaukee, Wisc., but he became Mr. Show Business by mixing classics with tunes from Tin Pan Alley, which endeared him to fans. He learned the value of publicity in his youth and cultivated attention by wearing extravagant costumes that drew crowds to his live shows and TV appearances. Also part of the act, according to Thomas, was the \"sincere wink\" lavished on older women who were Liberace's greatest admirers. The author is sympathetic to this victim of AIDS, without omitting to note that the performer denied under oath his homosexuality when he sued a British and an American journalist for libel. Thomas also reports on the unsuccessful attempt to cover up the true cause of the entertainer's illness that brought on his death in 1986 at age 67.

Machismo, sex, racy dialogueall the trappingsdefine the thriller but do not a Sam Spade make. Saxon moves around Los Angeles and its environs when beautiful Tori Weldon hires him to protect her father, author Buck Weldon. A millionaire on earnings from crime fiction he calls trash, Weldon has also created enmity; someone wants to kills him. The detective questions an embezzling movie producer, prototype for a Weldon work-in-progress; his former son-in-law, whom he beat severely for battering Tori; the publisher who stole Weldon's royalties; and others. During the investigation, the writer's lover dies instantly from poisoned cocaine that she snuffs before he does, the latest failed attempt to murder him. One of the novel's weaknesses is that the police take no steps against Weldon in the case, although he and the woman were alone in his house. Another is Saxon's failure to pick up the flaming clue in the early chapters.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Shackles: A &quot;Nameless Detective&quot; Mystery", "content": " An appearance by Pronzini's Nameless Detective is always a promising event; in his latest case, with its echoes of Geoffrey Household's Rogue Male, Nameless delivers on that promise with more punch and sensibility than ever. Kidnapped one winter night near his home in San Francisco, he is driven to a remote mountain cabin and left, chained in a leg iron, with only enough supplies to last three or four months: his masked captor has planned a slow and vengeful death. Enduring solitude and physical hardship, summoning great effort of will, Nameless survives, escapes and, as a profoundly altered man, sets off to find his would-be murderer. A complicated and unexpected resolution of near-perfect length balances the intense drama of Nameless's captivity. With his steady and reliable output as both author and editor, Pronzini has quietly established a reputation as a master of the modern mystery. Shackles, with its many satisfactions, should move right to the top.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Norma: The Story of Norma Shearer", "content": " This is the latest of Quirk's many books ( Claudette Colbert , Bette Davis et al.) on Hollywood in its heyday, when the stars really glittered, none more brightly than Norma Shearer. Thoroughly researched, the biography describes her life from her birth in Montreal in 1900 until her death at age 83. Refuting the arguments that the actress owed her triumphs to her first husband, Irving Thalberg, head of MGM, the author includes informed critiques of her memorable performances. He also emphasizes Shearer's successes after Thalberg's death at age 37, as well as the business sense that left her in control of the couple's stock in the studio. When she retired in 1942, the actress had made an enviable reputation as the incomparable, elegantly sexy character of such major films as The Barretts of Wimpole Street , A Free Soul , Escape , The Women and others.

A checkered career that included four years as a Marine and sudden celebrity as a model preceded his involvement with Priscilla. Their grand passion and the abortion of their child are recounted in juicy, true-romance stylesome of it unintentionally funny. The relationship was haunted and eventually destroyed by the dead singer's ever-present spirit and the author's efforts to take Elvis's place at the price of his own identity, according to Edwards. His drinking, womanizing, growing attraction to teenager Lisa and Pricilla's increasing assertiveness and budding career as a TV actress further estranged the pair and ultimately led to their final break-up.

A youth tempted to suicide by failures, Carnegie nevertheless kept seeking the key to success which he finally found and shared with other aspirants. The authors describe the Carnegie Course, subject of his bestselling How to Win Friends and Influence People , published in 1936. While the authors maintain that their book is not intended to promote the course, their reports on sessions in progress seem, perhaps inevitably, like endorsements. The book is, however, an interesting account of Carnegie the man and of his teaching, which combines elements of method acting and group encounters.

The French author, formerly married to a Cambodian, writes that she was resented as a member of a former colonial ruling presence and despised elite. After four years of working as a recruit in Khmer Rouge offices and in a camp in deserted Phnom Penh, the pregnant Picq and her two daughters were subjected to a 23-day forced march to the Thai border, described in exhaustive, grim detail, during which she suffered the birth and death of a son.

The spotlight is primarily on lyricist Alan Jay Lerner (1919-1986) who made more news, usually scandalous, than did composer Frederick \"Fritz\" Loewe (1901-1985). The team that created My Fair Lady , Gigi and Camelot shares space in the text with the shows' stars: Rex Harrison, Richard Burton, Julie Andrews, etc., as well as director Moss Hart. The prolix author also includes data on Lerner's Oscar-winning work on An American in Paris and his failures after his breakup with Loewe: On a Clear Day and Paint Your Wagon . There is information as well on the lyricist's amphetamine addiction, eight wives and extramarital affairs. Lees names the mysterious lover whom Doris Shapiro, Lerner's assistant, in her book, We Danced All Night , referred to as \"Mrs. Douglas\": Jean Kennedy Smith.

{"title": "A First Class Murder (An Eleanor Roosevelt Mystery)", "content": " This is Eleanor Roosevelt's ninth appearance as the fictional sleuth created by the former first lady's recently deceased novelist son. Here the author of Murder in the Blue Room takes Eleanor away from the White House and environs, surrounding her with first-class accommodations--and classy but suspicious characters--aboard the luxury liner Normandie. When a shady Russian envoy traveling to the U.S. is murdered and a stash of jewels owned by White Russians is missing, Eleanor must assess the motives of privileged passengers, including a Russian ballerina emigree, and such real-life characters as Charles Lindbergh, Mr. and Mrs. Jack Benny, Henry Luce, Josephine Baker and a young John F. Kennedy. It's all great fun enlivened by sophisticated dialogue and a splash of a conclusion, even though the celebrity characters other than the sleuth could benefit by portraits of greater depth. Eleanor makes a believable detective and the 1938 prewar atmosphere lends a nice touch of tension to a shipshape plot.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

The sister of Maria Callas and self-described \"saint\" repeatedly tells us that she has been much put upon: by her mother; her sister, who so disregarded her older and only sibling that there was no contact for a period of nine years; her lover, who would not marry her and died leaving his mistress of 28 years in virtual poverty; Vasso Devetzi, the diva's friend who, she charges, not only stole heavily from her sister's estate but hogged the limelight as the singer's legend posthumously grew. This tale of woe and self-sacrifice can be revealed now, presumably, because the villains have all passed on to their just deserts, and the author, too, has finally received her reward via much-wanted marriage.

{"title": "The Coming War With Japan", "content": " This disturbing book offers an original, penetrating analysis of the future of U.S.-Japanese relations. The authors argue that with the collapse of the Cold War and with the Soviet Union in disarray, the U.S. will no longer endure Japan's economic encroachments. Japan, meanwhile, in order to ensure the influx of raw materials and to secure an export market it can dominate politically, will solidify its trading bloc in Southwest Asia and the Indian Ocean, while challenging U.S. hegemony in the Pacific Basin. As the U.S. converts its global military supremacy into economic leverage, America and a rearmed Japan will be set on a collision course; the rivalry between them could well spill over into a \"hot war,\" the authors maintain. Friedman, a political science professor at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, and freelance writer LeBard sometimes overstate their thesis, yet their scenario is plausible and is buttressed by an appraisal of the two nations' conflicting imperial ambitions from the 1890s to the present.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

As narrated by Stephanie, the book pretty much puts to rest the rumor that the cheerleaders were concubines for the athletes: fraternization was forbidden and few members of the troupe would risk losing their jobs, even though the young women were exploited economically and a number of them used cocaine to stay skeletally thin. The book points out too that Texas is \"filled with macho men with nothing else to do but play football\" and with groupies, for whom cheering for Dallas was the summit of their ambition. The breathless, gee-golly-wow tone of the tale would be off-putting if the book did not present such a telling picture of the vacousness of this Texas legend.

{"title": "The Masked Man", "content": " In his latest historical mystery, Doherty ( The Fate of Princes ) tackles the story of the Man in the Iron Mask, a prisoner of such political consequence that Louis XIV of France ordered him locked away, forbidden to speak to anyone and condemned forever to wear a mask to hide his identity. (Dumas pere turned this actual historical incident into the famous novel.) Here, both Louis and the mysterious prisoner are dead when Ralph Croft, master forger, is plucked from the Bastille and enlisted by the French regent to determine the masked man's identity. Working with murderous musketeer D'Estrivet and royal archivist Maurepas, he uncovers a web of intrigue that involves plots against the crown, the Knights Templar and a fallen finance minister. There are even occasional winking references to those other famous Dumas characters, the Three Musketeers. Doherty's exposition of the historical record is often clumsy, and he cannot resist letting Croft somewhat anachronistically ponder the fate of the ancien regime.

In 1963, Woodlawn hitchhiked from his Miami home to New York City where, transformed by hormone treatments, makeup and the conviction that he was glamorous, he spent the '60s and '70s freeloading, substance-abusing, appearing in loosely scripted films (including Trash ) and worshipping Andy Warhol. The Manhattan written about here is of legendary bygone days when thriving bathhouses hosted cabaret acts and the Studio 54 disco achieved notoriety among a cocaine-addled crowd. Outrageous and bawdy, this is Woodlawn's celebration of licentiousness and his catty cohorts including ill-fated Warhol proteges Jackie Curtis and Candy Darling; the book is evasive in discussing the perils of drug use and the AIDS crisis, but its '90s perspective lends a wistful air to its account of a reckless past.

Here he records his part in a legal hunt with a company licensed by the Namibian government to take 10 elephants annually in the northeastern region of the country, part of the northern Kalhari Desert, where some 1000 old bull elephants range, about a dozen dying of old age each year. The sparsely populated area is home to the Bushmen, one of the last hunter-gatherer tribes, whose way of life the author intended to film. Another aspect of the safari was Capstick's signed agreement to hunt \"problem animals\" to reduce predation by lions and leopards, and he was accompanied by a native guard to ensure that the meat went to natives. In his lively account of adventures amid stifling heat and dust, Capstick tells of encounters with poisonous snakes, of learning about poison arrows from Bushmen and of getting his elephant. He argues that Namibia's legal hunting is a desirable practice, benefiting local people and the national economy. Photos.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

The church was established to serve chiefly gays and lesbians of various religious persuasions. Despite modest beginnings, internal schisms and the firebombings of 12 of his churches, Perry's mission was bolstered by formidable self-confidence--demonstrated in this less than modest chronicle coauthored with freelance writer Swicegood--and came to flourish in hundreds of churches established across the nation. Included along with accounts of gay activism in the '70s and '80s are personal stories of religious discovery and social solidarity which gays, rejected by established denominations (Perry himself was excommunicated for his sexual preference) affirm in his churches.

{"title": "The Market Square Dog", "content": " Yorkshire veterinarian and bestselling author Herriot has come up with yet another winning tale about one of the many animals that crossed his path over the years. This time it's a dog, which he spies begging in the town square one market day. The story of how the little stray finds a home with a sympathetic policeman and his family tugs at the heartstrings as only a Herriot tale can--and in all fairness, should probably carry a warning label for parents who have steadfastly resisted their child's pleas for a pet. As in their other collaborations, Brown's softly shaded watercolors recall an England of an earlier era, a place of cozy stone cottages and country gardens.

{"title": "Raid on Qaddafi: The Untold Story of History's Longest Fighter Mission by the Pilot Who Directed It", "content": " On April 14-15, 1986, Operation El Dorado Canyon, a military retaliation raid, was carried out by the Air Force and the Navy against Libya for its connivance and collaboration in terrorist activities against the United States. Colonel Venkus commanded the Air Force component that led the attack. In a crisp manner he presents the operational details of the planning and execution of the military mission against the North African leader, Muammar Qaddafi. The considerable detail here should interest military history buffs as well as those who follow American foreign policy in the region. The author concludes that the mission was a military success despite the losses in men and aircraft. His approach to the political aftermath is somewhat more muted. He touches briefly on the theory that the real mission was to assassinate the Libyan leader. Ultimately, he attempts to justify the Air Force piggybacking onto the recent military action in the Persian Gulf. This is recommended for a broad audience.- Sanford R.

{"title": "Northwest Epic: The Building of the Alaska Highway", "content": " In response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Army in early 1942 began a colossal and controversial undertaking--the feverish construction of a 1500-mile gravel road through largely unmapped and rugged northwest Canada to Fairbanks, Alaska. Overcoming ice, racist attitudes, morale problems and other obstacles, the project was rushed to successful completion in two years at a cost of $500 million. Twichell ( Allen ), spurred by the unpublished memoirs of his father, who, as an Army officer, worked on the road, provides the most comprehensive history of the Alcan yet written. The author's powerful treatment of the project--combining the CANOL oil pipeline and Northwest Staging Route for airplanes in one dazzling road--rages from explorations in the region in 1789 to Sen. Harry Truman's star-rising probe as head of a commission investigating Army projects and Twichell's findings as he follows the route a half century later.

{"title": "Good Rockin' Tonight: Sun Records and the Birth of Rock 'N' Roll", "content": " The authors, freelance writers, build a credible case for their assertion that the Sun studio was the birthplace of rock 'n' roll. Sun's founder, Sam Phillips, was the first to record artists who blended country music with rhythm and blues (R & B), creating the \"rockabilly\" sound that set the direction rock 'n' roll has taken to the present day. Sun, a Memphis, Tenn.-based label formed in 1952, never attained the level of success of the major record companies. But Phillips, a former disc jockey who broke into the record industry by recording R & B artists such as Howlin' Wolf and Joe Louis Hill, remains a seminal, almost legendary figure in modern music history, having discovered Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison and a host of lesser-known performers who have influenced recording artists of the past 40 years. Well-written and well-researched, the book is a worthy addition to the growing literature of rock 'n' roll.

{"title": "Midnight's Lair", "content": " Fast-paced and tightly constructed, this novel by the author of The Stake combines the best elements of psycho-slasher thrillers, disaster epics and classic supernatural horror tales. When a power failure traps a tourist group deep in Mordock's Cavern, tour guide Darcy Raines leads a small team that attempts to break through Ely's Wall, a man-made barrier sealing off one end of the cave. Creepy Kyle Mordock, teenage descendant of Ely, the wall's builder, and son of the attraction's current owner, is along on the tour because of his morbid erotic fascination with the beautiful Darcy. Flashbacks reveal that he has recently inherited a longstanding Mordock family trait, namely, the propensity to rape and murder female guests of the Mordock Cave Hotel and dump the bodies in the sealed-off part of the cave. Laymon adds fiendishly clever topspin to this gruesome revelation, placing on the other side of the wall a danger grislier and more bizarre than any natural disaster or psychotic killer. Horror fans will relish this highly entertaining tale.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "The Irish Troubles: A Generation of Violence 1967-1992", "content": " Author of numerous books on political violence, including three dealing with the outlawed Irish Republican Army, Bell, a historian at Columbia University, is well qualified to record the most recent chapter in Ireland's troubled history. He writes vividly of the conflict, creating a memorable picture of the significant events and personalities of this tragic drama; he is even-handed in his depictions of the IRA, its Protestant paramilitary counterparts and the British Army. Bell reflects poignantly on the few occasions when peace might have been restored if one of the factions or the representatives of official political interests had responded differently. Even more sadly, he sees no end to the conflict. This is an impressive work.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Cricket Explained", "content": " The complexities of the game of cricket are lost on most Americans. Eastaway, an avid cricketer, attempts to remedy this situation in a short yet inclusive look at a sport that is popular in Great Britain as well as numerous nations around the world, usually former British colonies. In addition to dispensing some basic history, the author attempts to show exactly what happens on the playing field, which player does what and why, and what all the baffling terminology (googly, flipper, cow corner, tonk, etc.) means. Those already bitten by the cricket \"bug\" (pun intended) will find this work helpful, but if readers don't have much interest in cricket to begin with, this book will probably not instill any. Written mostly in a question-and-answer format, with illustrations that are more cutesy than useful, this title will probably be of limited interest. Libraries that maintain in-depth sports collections should consider purchasing. Others can get by with a good sports or general encyclopedia.- David M.

{"title": "Fleur (Kirov Saga, Part 2)", "content": " This somewhat arch historical romance, the second book (after Anna ) in the author's projected Kirov trilogy, has as its heroine a Victorian innocent named Fleur, an outspoken 24-year-old of proper English birth who, rescued from ruffians by the visiting Russian Count Kirov, falls madly in love with her savior and his solemn, brooding eyes. He spurns her, and she is devastated. Almost two years later, traveling to St. Petersburg with family, she cannot resist seeing her count one more time. A slave to her heart, she agrees to stay with him, chastely, after his marriage of convenience to the woman Fleur's brother loves. The outbreak of the Crimean War pits Russia against Britain and France, and Fleur's brother, a member of the famous Light Brigade, against Fleur's true love. Although the description of British society in the 1850s is solid enough, the Russian settings are vaguely rendered. Smooth prose doesn't compensate for inconsistent characterization, and the resolution of the complex romantic muddle is hasty and artificial.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Part 1 describes homeopathy--material that can easily be found in other sources. Part 2 takes 13 common health concerns of women and details their causes, symptoms, and treatment. Part 3, \"A-Z of Other Conditions,\" briefly suggests treatments for other diseases. The authors, both British M.D.s, always recommend a balance between homeopathic and more mainstream kinds of medical care. Several appendixes include a general remedy finder where the reader can look up homeopathic treatment for individual diseases and a listing of the ingredients of homeopathic remedies.

Ice T on corruption: \"more crime prevention has to occur within the ranks of the crime-prevention organizations than among the people on the street.\" On Bryant Gumbel: he is \"the epitome of a black-skinned white person.\" Ice T also includes samples of his lyrics, which are printed across the bottom of the first 159 pages, an inventive innovation. As for the poetry, the diction is scatological, the rhymes simple and predictable, the message anti-establishment.

{"title": "Wild, High and Tight: The Life and Death of Billy Martin", "content": " Martin (1928-1989) grew up poor in Berkeley, Calif. A high school drop-out, he tried out for the Oakland baseball team of the Pacific Coast League; the manager was Casey Stengel, who took Martin to New York when he became manager of the Yankees. There Martin played a key role on several championship teams. But a drunken fistfight--which seems to be Martin's favorite recreation--at a nightclub ended his Yankee career. The other central figure in this book is Yankee owner George Steinbrenner. In alternating chapters Golenbock shows how the lives of Martin and Steinbrenner paralleled each other, which, ironically, highlights Martin's achievements and magnifies Steinbrenner's ineptitude. Golenbock ( The Bronx Zoo ) looks into Martin's womanizing, his prodigious drinking and his death in a car accident. Although his friend, Bill Reedy, was charged with driving while impaired, Golenbock maintains that Martin was the drunk driver. This is an extremely thorough and comprehensive biography of one of baseball's most controversial figures. Photos. Major ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

There is, however, very little racing information (e.g., no advice is given regarding the setting and flying of spinnakers).

{"title": "Coyote Wind: A Gabriel Du Pre Mystery", "content": " The author of the Yellowstone Kelly mysteries introduces a new regional detective in Montana cattle inspector and sometime sheriff's deputy, Gabriel Du Pre, a Metis, whose ancestors are French and Cree. The 40-year-old widower and father of two daughters wrestles with the mystery of a newly discovered, three-decades old plane wreck with the remains of a rancher, his wife and a third headless, handless corpse. In the process of investigating, Du Pre becomes acquainted with the man whose family bought the ranch where the wreck was later found. He also uncovers the tainted history of his deceased parents and an eccentric aunt who lives in Canada and searches an old gold mining claim once owned by his father to discover the answer that links his family with the rancher's. Distinguished by realistic dialogue, a fluid inclusion of local history and Du Pre's convincing concern with guilt, repentance and tradition, this is a deeply textured tale.

{"title": "Bums No More!: The Championship Season of the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers", "content": " During the early 1950s, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Yankees were pitted against each other several times in the World Series, with the Bronx Bombers always emerging victorious. The pattern was broken in 1955, however, when the Brooklyn team won its first and only world championship in seven hold-your-breath games. Although many books have been written about that legendary season, Wolpin, an ex-sportswriter for the Newark (N.J.) Star-Ledger, captures as few authors have the significance of the Dodgers to their home borough, whose residents felt the equal of Manhattan as long as they had \"Dem Bums.\" Wolpin catches this sense of bonding principally by sprinkling his text with quotes from fans who recall their individual joy and the borough's collective frenzy when their team won. So it doesn't seem like hyperbole when Wolpin equates the departure of the Dodgers after the 1957 season with the death of the borough. Photos.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Shapiro ( Waiting for the Man: Drugs and Popular Music ) and Glebbeek, founder of the Hendrix Information Centre in Ireland, regale the reader with quotes, anecdotes, song analyses and mini-bios of Hendrix colleagues, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience's drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding. The musician is portrayed as a perfectionist, brilliant composer whose imaginative sound effects were limited only by equipment; a black artist under pressure from radical black groups because his audience was predominantly white; a dedicated guitarist overwhelmed by his lifestyle. Hendrix's drug abuse and death from a probable barbiturate overdose are not sensationalized as the authors concentrate on his formidable music legacy, flamboyant individualism and sense of humor.

Wilson, himself a mystery novelist (Death by Degrees) groups the stories by twos, according to six aspects of fiction: plot, character, setting, theme, point of view and style. The authors are either influential in the field (Greg Bear, Bruce Sterling, Joe Haldeman) or are known as writers' writers (Kim Stanley Robinson, John Kessel, Howard Waldrop). The tales range from symbolic imagery or magic realism (Lucius Shepherd, Karen Joy Fowler, James Patrick Kelly) to mainstream SF (Pat Cadigan, Greg Bear). Most, like Nancy Kress's \"The Price of Oranges\" or Pat Murphy's \"Rachel in Love,\" combine SF and mainstream literary conventions. Each pairing is introduced by an essay from Wilson, and the book concludes with a lexicon of SF workshop terms from Bruce Sterling.

Writing in the first person with coauthor Ketcham (with whom she wrote Witness for the Defense), Loftus critiques the tools used by some therapists (\"trance work,\" hypnosis, dream analysis, journal writing, etc.) to \"recover\" patients' buried memories. She presents numerous case histories involving presumed memories that turned out to be fabrications and reports on a study in which false memories of childhood events were created in men and women volunteers. She also discusses her involvement in the case of Paul Ingram, a Washington deputy sheriff who confessed that he was a priest in a satanic cult and sodomizer of children after his two daughters accused him of sexual abuse; he later retracted his confession but was imprisoned anyway.

He's got a villa in Spain, two houses in Scotland, the world's best behaved newborn and the world's most resilient new mother, in her late 30s, for a wife. He's a crack shot and a tough-fisted guy with a crass, insensitive, sexist posture who is a distinctly unpleasant fictional creation. In Skinner's third appearance, after Skinner's Festival, a crime lord is murdered in Edinburgh, and a property swindle is uncovered in a Spanish resort town. Skinner gets to log some flying hours, shout at admiring subordinates, swear unnecessarily in mixed company and solve two cases that the author links by coincidence rather than design. Jardine's collection of villains is instantly forgettable. With the exception of the amazingly stalwart Ms. Skinner, most of the women in the book are odoriferous hookers or office underlings required to serve biscuits and coffee to Skinner and the other North Country Neanderthals he hangs out with.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Assisted by historian Wolf, Means tells his story with vernacular frankness, regularly slamming Eurocentrism. While Means's love for his people and his anger at America's historic depredations seem genuine, his conclusion steals some of his thunder (and contradicts his opposition to intermarriage): after finally entering therapy to cope with his anger, he determines that \"feelings and relationships\" matter far more than race or culture.

The authors find imbedded in the sessions familiar causes of the Beatles' breakup: John concentrating on Yoko Ono; George feeling a lack of respect from the others; Ringo bored and haggard; and an optimistic Paul seemingly the only Beatle interested in continuing the legacy of the group.

Wodehouse, Dashiell Hammett and Edgar Rice Burroughs, were hired by a reclusive collector to make sense of the case notes left by Watson in his tin dispatch box. Kaye has asked contemporary authors to write in the style of genre forbears. Thus, Paula Volsky writes the dramatic \"The Giant Rat of Sumatra\" in the style of Lovecraft; Mike Resnick the hilarious \"Mrs. Vamberry Takes a Trip\" as Thorne Smith. In most cases, the adopted style is well-crafted, with the authors adroitly capturing the feel of their models. A few, such as Kaye's own Rex Stout parody, might have better remained in the tin box.

Although the author makes scant mention of the American witch trials and the treatment of slaves, he shows proof that this country was at one time more humane than Europe in its methods.

{"title": "Firedrake's Eye", "content": " Forget the publisher's misleading comparisons to the intellectual teasers Possession and The Name of the Rose and enjoy this highly colored historical novel on its own merits. Set in Elizabethan England, it sensuously reconstructs the era's visual pomp and splendor as well as the fetid odors and pervasive damp chill of a London winter. Finney ( A Shadow of Gulls ) endows her players with a rich language--essentially modern English lightly laced with fanciful syntax and Elizabethan vocabulary. The plot, in which members of Elizabeth's secret service ferret out would-be assassins of the Virgin Queen, is heavy with coincidence and short on actual sleuthing. These flaws, however, are camouflaged by an exotic, convincing cast of characters, among them a madman; Portuguese Jews who have found refuge behind the English throne; physicians; courtiers; teachers of swordplay; traitors and pretenders.

Indeed, eminent Presley biographer Guralnik (Last Train to Memphis) writes that, given Jorgensen's attention to detail, the author is \"either a madman or a great detective.\" While so many Presley books are written by authors who never seem to overcome their poetic sense of awe regarding the King, Jorgensen, being an RCA executive, couches the story of Presley's life in the gritty details of the artist's work and gets past the myths, giving readers a glimpse of what it might have been like to be Elvis. Hence, his is a truly insightful book. 150 photos in color and b&w.; Editor, Calvert D. Morgan.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

{"title": "Instant Analysis", "content": " Psychologist Lieberman would agree with Auntie Mame's comment that \"Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death.\" For too many of us, he insists, \"There's dullness instead of intensity and numbness in place of excitement.\" Lieberman blames this on what he calls automatic thinking and behaviors. To help the reader become aware of such behavior, he chooses a format of 100 questions and answers. Why do you feel the need to arrive early? Why are you so hard on yourself? Why do you apologize even when it's not your fault? The author explores plausible reasons for these automatic behaviors and presents ideas for changing them. His intent in this reader-friendly discussion is to replace the reader's tiredness and apathy with fresh ideas and vitality. While the questions and answers are entertaining, specific practical behaviors are also suggested for creating more positive thinking and actions. This practical, enjoyable book should find a wide readership in self-help collections in public libraries.?Catherine T.

{"title": "The Antimafia: Italy's Fight Against Organized Crime", "content": " The Mafia has long been a negative subcultural phenomenon in Sicily and throughout Italy. Partially responsible for keeping the peasants poor and oppressed, it has used countless acts of violence and intimidation against the country's legitimate social institutions. This was especially true in 1992 and 1993, when a series of bombings highlighted the Cosa Nostra's terror campaign against the Italian state. Two very prominent anti-Mafia judges were murdered, and it was increasingly clear that corruption permeated both the political system and business life of Italy. Jamieson, a freelance writer and author (The Heart Attacked: Terrorism and Conflict in the Italian State), uses interviews with senior judges, politicians, police officers, and relatives of Mafia victims in compiling this well-written book on the efforts of law enforcement and various political groups in their fight against the Mafia. Jamieson concludes that much progress has been made, but because the Mafia has aligned itself with the legal economy and international criminal alliances, she predicts that the Mafia will continue to exist and grow.

{"title": "Death in the Andamans", "content": " Originally published in England, this tale of romance and murder on a few tiny islands in the Indian Ocean was written in the '30s and is based on an actual experience of the then-young author. Copper Randal is visiting Valerie, a school friend who is the daughter of the commissioner of the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal. The British community there is small and eccentric, its predictable social rounds occasionally enlivened by visiting naval officers. A Christmas Eve picnic is interrupted by a raging tropical storm, during which an indigent British plantation owner is killed. A visiting Navy doctor voices suspicion of murder and is the next victim. With communications to the mainland cut, the storm still in force, terror takes over the island as the search for motive turns up a surprising number of suspects. One is handsome Nick Tarrent, friend of Valerie's fiance and object of Copper's troubling romantic fantasies. With its satisfying plot, deft characterization and emphasis on setting and atmosphere, this early effort from an established talent is both fresh and credible. 40,000 first printing.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

The remainder of these previously uncollected essays range widely over literature, science, morality and religion. Arguing that modern science \"cannot utter a single word\" about what is distinctive in human behavior, art and thought, Percy turns to semiotics for the beginnings of \"a coherent science of man.\" Modern fiction, he contends, serves a diagnostic and cognitive role in revealing us to ourselves in a century of spiritual disorientation.

{"title": "The Coldest War: A Memoir of Korea", "content": " As a new Marine second lieutenant, Brady, one-time publisher of Women's Wear Daily , joined Dog Company on the front line in Korea on Thanksgiving Day 1951 and departed the following Fourth of July with his hide intact. During that time he learned how to lead an infantry platoon in combat and later served as executive and intelligence officer of the company. The action sequences--patrols, ambushes, prisoner-snatching raids--are vivid and memorable, conveying the unique flavor of the second year of the \"peculiar war.\" Giving the memoir distinction, however, are the author's comments on those he served with, the prickly relations between Marine officers and enlisted men, and the differences between Marine and Army troops.

Her advice on the swing is straightforward and clearly explained, and she doesn't make the common mistake of trying to teach average players to swing like Tiger Woods. Much of the book is equally applicable to intermediate men players as well as women, but Stenzel does emphasize the parts of the game (using a full complement of fairway woods, for example) that are especially important for women, who typically don't hit the ball as far as men. Her chapters on chipping, pitching, and sand play are superb--good advice without the complexity that short-game guru Dave Pelz brings to the topic.

{"title": "Within These Walls: Memoirs of a Death House Chaplain", "content": " In 15 years, Pickett ministered to almost 100 condemned men in Texas. Because he was not allowed to hold their hands, he held the prisoners' ankles as they were administered lethal injections. This memoir, infused with the true crime style of coauthor Stowers, recalls the crimes of condemned men in horrifying detail, and then describes the equally upsetting state-sanctioned murder to which Reverend Pickett bore witness. Scenes outside of the death house show a chaplain of remarkable courage. Surviving divorce, a terrifying hostage crisis, and a frustrating morass of prison bureaucracy, Pickett persevered, bringing new life to the prison chapel and the prisoners who became his friends. Readers won't find theology here, or an analysis of how the awful things Pickett saw daily shaped his own spiritual path. Instead, this is a story of an extraordinary vocation, one for which being the chaplain sometimes meant sitting with a man, raped and bleeding, too terrified for his life to go to the hospital.

With much enthusiasm and little knowledge, she began her weekly trek to the local nursery to stock up on all varieties of seedlings. Why, she wondered, did they not flourish after being planted in the bare backyard? Only after many mistakes, much expense, and worrisome encounters with weeds and bugs was she able to transform her little plot into \"a garden with soul,\" jumbled and luxuriant.

To thwart a resurgence of fascism just a few years after the Nazis' defeat, the thief must recover some compromising records that implicate a member of the royal family in a right-wing conspiracy. Complicating Jethro's efforts to serve his handlers is a gangland war that threatens those dearest to him. Unfortunately, the author fails to match his engaging, roguish hero with a suitable plot.

Edghill transforms a didactic fable, the story of King Solomon and his brief interaction with the Queen of Sheba, into a powerful love story of a man and the queen who won his heart. Rotating among multiple narrators-- including several of Solomon's 40 wives; his daughter Baalit; Bilqis, the Queen of Sheba; Solomon's war general; and Solomon himself--Edghill tells the story of why Bilqis came to King David's City and why Solomon lavished her with gifts and eventually gave her his daughter. Leisurely paced and focused on the wisdom of Solomon and the burdens of his reign, this atmospheric story is packed with political intrigue, illuminating the curious mixture of cultures and religions among the women of Solomon's court.Jennifer BakerCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

While many  academic libraries may exercise caution in these economically  stressful times in purchasing expensive collections of essays, this particular work deserves a second glance. Scholars such as  Jeffrey Record, George C. Herring, William J.

Zipes has  significantly revised and expanded his book, responding both to  its earlier critics and to the wealth of new work on the Grimms  to come out of East Germany since the fall of the Berlin Wall.  He is concerned with both the artistry and the ideology of the  tales. While agreeing that the Grimms often transformed their  tales to reflect the bourgeois values of their world, Zipes  wishes to avoid simplistic readings, exploring the complexity of  what such values actually meant. At the same time, Zipes is interested in their later reception and appropriation, including  the efforts of Disney. His new chapter on the legacy of the  Grimms in East and West Germany is especially illuminating.  Highly recommended.T.L.

Frey doesn't believe in those collections \"of tips on what to do and what not to do,\" arguing that they give the false impression that writing good fiction is merely a matter of mixing ingredients in the right proportions. Instead, Frey contains, the key to a good mystery isn't picking clues and getting the technical stuff right; it's a matter of finding the right people to tell your story, finding the right words to frame it, finding the right sequence of events to maximize suspense. Frey also spends time on an important but frequently neglected aspect of the writerly trade: the audience. Who reads mysteries, and what do they expect from them? Meanwhile, he tackles the nuts and bolts in a particularly clever manner, by guiding the reader through the creation of a virtual novel, which he callsMurder in Montana.

As a candidate for the office of aedile, he's busy cultivating voters by paying for expensive games and contests. The murder of the tribune Ateius, after he publicly places a dreadful curse on consul Crassus and his army, stirs up civil unrest. The consul Pompey charges Decius with finding the tribune's killer before the mobs burn the city. Through the engaging, humorous voice of Decius, the author portrays such prominent figures of the Roman Republic as Cato and Cicero, while bringing to life the ancient city with its sights and smells, manners and customs, politics and religion. (Decius confesses that he's confused by the monotheism that exists in the eastern Mediterranean provinces.) Despite a predictable ending, readers will surely look forward to Decius's future adventures.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "A Disease Apart: Leprosy in the Modern World", "content": " For millennia, sufferers of Hansen's disease, commonly known as leprosy, have endured not only the illness' devastating effects but also unspeakable cruelty at the hands of those around them. Indeed, some of the worst offenders have been those charged with caring for the afflicted. Gould says it is the combination of leprosy's mysterious causes and its horrific physical manifestations that inspires such behavior. In this thoughtful book, he traces leprosy's recent history by examining the lives of people who have made a difference, ranging from household names like Father Damien to such lesser-known heroes as Stanley Stein, who waged a victorious battle against the U.S. Public Health Service. Despite what appear to be great strides--the author cites leprosarium closures from declining incidence of the disease in industrialized nations--Gould claims the battle is far from over. For there is no cure, no preventive vaccine, nor any good idea yet as to either cause or how leprosy is spread. Moreover, leprosy still occurs in many areas of the Third World.Donna ChavezCopyright &#169; American Library Association. All rights reserved"}

{"title": "Arch Angels (Joe Keough Mysteries)", "content": " Randisi's fifth Joe Keough thriller/mystery (after 2002's East of the Arch) features a distinctive double plot and plenty of humanizing detail, though the disparate elements never quite form a coherent whole. Keough, now a member of the Federal Serial Killer Task Force, and partner Harriet Connors are dispatched from Washington to St. Louis and Chicago, respectively. In St. Louis, three young girls have been kidnapped and strangled; in Chicago, three young boys have been kidnapped and strangled. There are odd parallels among the murders, and the pair must determine if there is one killer or two. The author lets the reader in on the answer early (both killers appear separately), but neither detective picks up on the clues to their quirky relationship as quickly as one might expect. Still, Randisi manages to wring plenty of tension from the petty turf battles between feds and locals and the fear that another victim will die before Keough and Connors can catch the culprits.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While many of these career topics are discussed in other books, this volume offers a fresh perspective in several areas; sections on changing careers and using volunteer jobs as a way of getting a new position are particularly insightful. Furthermore, the solutions are realistic. For example, regarding reliable child care, the authors discuss the advantages of having a family member (sibling, spouse or grandmother) available for child care or emergency care. This is a solid guide that should appeal to mothers who can't or don't want to return to their previous careers.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Red Star Rising: A Thriller", "content": " Last seen in 2002's Kings of Many Castles, working-class British spy Charlie Muffin once again proves that experience and intelligence (on the part of both author and hero) are at least as important as flying fists and explosions in this entertaining entry in Freemantle's long-running series. When a faceless body turns up on the grounds of the British Embassy in Moscow, Charlie's superiors send him to Russia to solve the mystery: who's the corpse and why was he left face down, or rather no face down, in the flower garden? Nothing is as it seems as the Russian authorities wrestle with the British over who has jurisdiction, whose agents are the bigger liars, and whose government is the most underhanded. Charlie isn't much for action, gunplay, and excitement. In fact, his relationship with his Russian intelligence officer wife, Natalie, and daughter Sasha provides most of the overt suspense, but his slow fitting together of all the pieces related to the crime provides genuine interest.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Weaver and the Factory Maid (Ringan Laine, 1)", "content": " A cozy series based on folk ballads with ghosts may be good in theory, but in her mystery debut, Grabien, the author of a couple of mystical fantasies (The Eyes in the Fire; Plainsong), offers too little plot and a less than engaging protagonist, the self-centered Ringan Laine. An English musician and architect, Ringan specializes in restoring old houses. After he obtains a life interest in a West Country barn and cottage from a defaulting client, he discovers that the former building is haunted by the ghost of a lovelorn weaver, the latter by the spirit of the girl the weaver loved. The deceased make their presence felt to Ringan and his hearty girlfriend, Penny Wintercraft-Hawkes, who enjoin others to help lay the ghosts to rest. The only mystery here, given away on the back of the galley, doesn't amount to much by conventional crime standards. Handselling to folklore fans and New Agers may help take up the slack left by disappointed mystery readers.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Maverick U.S. intelligence agent Todd Belknap, known as the Hound for his superior ability to track his quarry, heads to Lebanon to try to find a fellow agent who has been kidnapped. Meanwhile, Andrea Bancroft, a brainy and beautiful hedge-fund analyst who has agreed to serve on the board of her family's mysterious foundation, begins to suspect that behind the Bancroft Foundation's benevolent facade lie sinister conspiracies. Unsurprisingly, those conspiracies intersect with Belknap's search. Throw in a secret cabal controlling world events and a high body count, and you have predictable genre fare.600,000 first printing.

After falling out of touch, they exchanged the letters collected in this book from August to November of 2002, cycling through anguish, accusation, artifice, allowance, appreciation-all of the beginnings of real friendship.

{"title": "The Writing Class", "content": " Can a class of wannabe novelists solve a murder in their midst? That's the premise of this dark comedy of the absurd from Willett (Winner of the National Book Award), a boisterous satire of pseudointellectuals, impotent writers and the adult extension programs of public universities. The only things Amy Gallup, a once-noted California author, has published in years are blurbs of other writers' work. Amy's only income comes from teaching fiction writing to a motley collection of varyingly talented prepublished adults. Someone in the class is making threatening phone calls and sending extremely cruel notes to other students. When two of the students are murdered, a deep sense of danger takes hold. Yet the class goes on. Amy's lectures actually constitute a damn fine guide to writing fiction, while Willett's prose has sparkling moments (The line was playful, offhand, the poem itself a smug, imperious cat stretch). The tension is so strong that readers can hardly resist the temptation to peek ahead and see which student is the killer.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Spider Mountain: A Novel", "content": " Full of imaginative plotting touches, Deutermann's fast-paced sequel to his acclaimed 2005 suspense novel,The Cat Dancers, finds Cam Richter, formerly a lieutenant with the Manceford County, N.C., sheriff's office, now doing less stressful work as the head of a PI firm staffed with other ex-cops. Park ranger Mary Ellen Goode, Richter's more-than-colleague who was severely traumatized in their last joint inquiry, reaches out to him for help after a probationary ranger is raped and left for dead in a Smoky Mountains national park. Richter's inquiries soon reveal that the crime was tangentially related to a much bigger criminal conspiracy, possibly centered on methamphetamine sales orchestrated by a figure out of a Grimm's fairy tale, the evil Grinny Creigh, and her incestuous clan. The author's impressive ability to bring the remote Appalachian region to life bodes well for the health of this series.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

On returning to Millers Kill, N.Y., Clare jumps right back into her duties as priest of St. Alban's Episcopalian Church. But her 18 months flying helicopters in Iraq aren't entirely in the past: she's drinking more and relying on a mix of leftover pills from her Army medical kit. Along with several other returning service members, Clare joins a community support group for veterans. When a member of the group, Tally McNab, apparently shoots herself in the mouth and falls dead into her swimming pool, Clare spearheads an investigation, hounding Russ to consider homicide. Clare and Russ's relationship deepens, while the focus on the struggles of veterans supplies another strong emotional thread. Author tour; 75,000 first printing. (Apr.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

{"title": "The Angels of Morgan Hill (Women of Faith Fiction)", "content": " The story of a black family's move to a small all-white Tennessee town in 1947 inspires inspirational novelist VanLiere (Christmas Hope;Christmas Shoes; etc.) to expand her fictional range while trying to expand her audience. Narrator Jane Gable recalls two critical life events on the same spring day when she was nine years old: the funeral of her alcoholic father and the arrival of a black family of sharecroppers, the first blacks Jane has ever seen in Morgan Hill. Both events converge to make life harder for the impoverished Gables; Jane's mother, Fran, is pregnant, and the black Turner family, hired to work on a tobacco farm, is slighted, harassed and threatened. When the Turners' house burns down, Milo, the only survivor, is taken in by the Gables. VanLiere uses humor, memories of growing up Southern and touching moments of family unity to enrich her story of overcoming racism and poverty. Her retreat into familiar territory (another charming Christmas pageant, another holiday full of joy and sentiment) will satisfy fans of her earlier work.Author tour.(Oct 17)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Village Affairs", "content": " Chan's second contemporary homage to Dorothy Sayers (after 2005'sThe Young Widow) lacks the subtle characterization and meticulous plotting of the Lord Peter Wimsey saga, though cozy fans should enjoy the charming Cotswolds setting, in particular the congenial local pub where much of the action takes place. Scotland Yard detective Jack Gibbons and his well-to-do friend, Phillip Bethancourt, go to Chipping Chedding to investigate the death of one of the village's most popular residents, Charlie Bingham. While a possibly accidental mix of sleeping pills and whiskey did Charlie in, his body having been moved to the fireside where it was found raises suspicions. A surfeit of sleuths, including one of Jack's police superiors and Phillip's bumbling host, muddles the evidence gathering.

{"title": "The Naked Woman: A Study of the Female Body", "content": " Undeniably the quintessential observer of the human condition, best-selling Morris casts his discerning eye upon the feminine form in this top-to-toe tour of all things female in a continuation of the inquiry he began with the seminalThe Naked Ape(1967). Scrutinizing everything from hair to feet, Morris explores the evolutionary, cultural, and biological traits and tendencies that have caused woman to become the creature she is today. Morris is positively giddy with admiration for his subject, stating that the human female is \"far more advanced\" than her male counterpart, the result of evolutionary developments that make her the \"most remarkable organism\" on the planet. And yet, Morris avers, woman has not come far enough--at least in some global cultures, where male domination runs counter to human biological imperative. Thus, each chapter, which correlates to body parts as subtle as the brow and as expected as the breasts, examines how each characteristic has been shaped by social authority. Always entertaining, Morris takes a complex subject and cogently dissects it in fine detail for a critically enlightening experience.Carol HaggasCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

Formerly a detective with the Cleveland PD, Perry was forced out of the department when he assaulted a rich lawyer, Alex Jefferson, who had married Perry's still beloved ex, Karen. When Jefferson's brutalized corpse is discovered in a field, suspicion soon focuses on Perry, and the gumshoe only makes more trouble for himself by accepting Karen's commission to find the dead man's estranged son, Matt, who has inherited millions from his father. But no sooner does Perry locate Matt in Indiana than the unwitting heir commits suicide in Perry's presence, another death the authorities find suspicious. Despite Koryta's youth (his 2004 debut,Tonight I Said Goodbyewas published when he was 21), his haunting writing and logical, sophisticated plotting rival that of established stalwarts like Loren Estleman.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "My Big Fat Supernatural Wedding", "content": " Nine top fantasists imagine just how amusingly amok a wedding might run in this diverting compilation of original stories on the theme of nuptials among the fey folk. Jim Butcher, the sole male contributor, serves up the book's best romp, \"Something Borrowed,\" in which wizard detective Harry Dresden prompts a bridezilla rampage from a malevolent fairy when he tries to break up her wedding with the werewolf whose intended she is impersonating. In L.A. Banks's amusing \"Spellbound,\" descendants of the Hatfields and McCoys wage a slapstick war of spell and counterspell, while Charlaine Harris's \"Tacky\" projects the mishaps that might follow a mixed marriage between a werewolf and vampire. Possibly because most of the contributors are better known as novelists, the bulk of the stories read more like comic outtakes from larger works than independently plotted stories.

After two decades of his treasure troves of superlative sf, Dozois now sees fit to issue a retrospective compilation culling from all 20 of them. The results are breathtaking. Under one banner are assembled some of the best work of the genre's leading authors, from grandmasters Robert Silverberg, Gene Wolfe, and Ursula K.

A number of the selections are now considered classics--\"Blood Music,\" Greg Bear's Hugo-winning exploration of nanotechnology, for instance, and \"Bears Discover Fire,\" Terry Bisson's tongue-in-cheek consideration of future ursine evolution.

{"title": "The Baltic Gambit: An Alan Lewrie Naval Adventure (Alan Lewrie Naval Adventures)", "content": " Lambdin and his Napoleonic War hero, Capt. Alan Lewrie, do their usual nautical thing in the series' 15th installment, but this account of the Battle of Copenhagen takes a backseat to the main character's Tom Jones antics and some underdeveloped espionage activities. The novel begins, in prologue, with unfinished business from the previous novel (Troubled Waters), and soon, after cooling his heels in London and plotting personal revenge, Lewrie gets his new orders to deliver a peace delegation to Russia. Lewrie is then pressed into service to help Vice Adm. Lord Horatio Nelson defeat the Danish fleet at Copenhagen. For those who know history, the outcome of this engagement is never in doubt, but the author still has one surprise in store when the true purpose of the peace delegation is revealed. With his mannered style, leering sensibility and attenuated plotting, Lambdin has always been second tier to C.S. Forester.

{"title": "The Rainaldi Quartet", "content": " Starred Review.From the first stirring theme to the last fading chord, mystery fans and music lovers alike will be captivated by British author Adam's excellent contemporary thriller. Gianni Castiglione, a violin maker who lives in rural Italy, plays in a string quartet with fellow luthier Rainaldi, parish priest Father Arrighi and police detective Guastafeste. When Rainaldi is murdered after dropping hints about a search for a rare and magnificent violin, Father Arrighi conducts the funeral and Guastafeste investigates, aided by Castiglione's thorough knowledge of violin construction and history. As they travel across Italy and England tracking down clues and suspects, a rich and subtle story unfolds. Adam has constructed this tale with all the care and craftsmanship that Stradivari put into his instruments, filling it to the brim with deliciously caustic commentary on Italian city life and fascinating historical and musical detail. If the mystery itself is slightly less than compelling, it's because the storytelling almost overwhelms the crime solving.

Others may find that the task of navigating unfamiliar surroundings presents too little payoff. Like many amateur sleuths before her, college nurse Imogen Quy strides blithely into dangerous situations, in this case attempting to learn whether Sir Julius Farran, a wealthy businessman and college benefactor, fell to his death accidentally or was pushed. Her investigation, fueled by information her students tell her in confidence, proceeds through multilayered adulteries and financial shenanigans that rival Enron and put the college at risk of bankruptcy. Like the two earlier Imogen Quy mysteries (The Wyndham CaseandA Piece of Justice), this story is entirely plot driven and, except for one genuine surprise, that plot is largely unengaging.

Though there is little in the way of dialect changes and impersonation, listeners will be astounded at how close Hinch comes to capturing the Cruise persona.

Soon after Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government rounded up all the Japanese residents of the West Coast and shipped them off to \"internment camps\" for the duration of the war. One of the camps is Tallgrass, based on an actual Colorado camp, as Dallas (The Chili Queen) explains in her acknowledgments. The major discomforts and petty indignities these (mostly) American citizens had to endure are viewed through the clear eyes of a young girl who lives on a nearby farm, Rennie Stroud. Rennie's obvious love of family slowly extends itself to the Japanese house and field helpers the Strouds receive permission to hire. The final surprise is the who and why of the murder itself.

{"title": "Down River", "content": " Starred Review.Hart surpasses his bestselling debut,The King of Lies(2006), with his richly atmospheric second novel, which offers a tighter plot, more adroit pacing and less angst. Five years earlier, Adam Chase was arrested for murder, largely on the basis of his stepmother's sworn testimony against him. He was acquitted, but nearly everyone, including his father, still thinks he did it, and Adam's deep bitterness has kept him away from home ever since. Now, at the request of a childhood friend, he's back in Salisbury, N.C., where all the old demons still reside and new troubles await. The almost Shakespearean snarl of family ties is complicated by a very modern struggle between economic progress and love for the land, between haves and have-nots. Throughout, Hart expertly weaves his main theme: that by their freedom of choice, humans are capable of betrayal but also of forgiveness and redemption. This book should settle once and for all the question of whether thrillers and mysteries can also be literature.150,000 first printing; 15-city author tour.

The decapitation of a harmless pony is followed by the threefold Viking ritual murder of a female archeology student, who's been carrying on a torrid affair with a secret lover, then two more grisly executions, all punctuated by chilling glimpses into a psychopathic mind. The fluid translation evokes the stark economy of the ancient sagas, where all that mattered was how one fought and died.

{"title": "Think Twice", "content": " Bestseller Scottoline's 13th novel centered on the all-female Philadelphia law firm headed by Bennie Rosato (afterLady Killer) offers contrived situations and paper-thin characters on top of a premise that strains credibility. After Bennie's evil identical twin sister, Alice Connelly, drugs her and leaves her to die, buried in a remote farm field, Alice takes advantage of her physical resemblance to Bennie to assume her identity at the law firm as well as gain access to her wealth and, eventually, her ex-boyfriend. Many will wonder why the ruthless Alice didn't kill Bennie outright, leaving open the possibility that her victim will escape and attempt to foil her scheme. With authors like Lisa Unger proving that intelligent plotting and page-turning aren't incompatible, this tired effort is unlikely to win Scottoline new converts.500,000 first printing; author tour.

Lawyer and private inquirer Karl Werthen teams with criminologist Hanns Gross to look into this and subsequent accidents apparently aimed at Mahler. As the investigation descends into the damned politics of music, Mahler, a former Jew who must be careful to hide his contempt for fellow composer Richard Wagner, emerges as the nexus for an ever-widening pool of suspects. Complicating matters are big changes in Werthen's home life, in particular wife Berthe's pregnancy. Jones, the author ofHitler in Vienna, 1907&ndash;1913and other nonfiction books about the city, smoothly blends a compelling period whodunit with bountiful cultural and social details.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After Colin is charged with the investigation, the British crown reluctantly allows Emily to handle questioning within the harem. Emily follows the clues much farther afield, exploring the tangled histories of the victim's diplomat father from whom she was abducted many years before, her troubled archeologist brother and sultans both current and deposed. The author deftly handles the exotic setting and a subplot in which Emily worries she may be pregnant, but a lack of tension and a number of implausibilities, starting with the ease with which a Western woman can play detective in despotic, late 19th-century Constantinople, make this a relatively weak entry. Hopefully, Emily will recover her usual sparkle once the newlyweds return to more familiar ground.Author tour.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In late 2007, Jimmy Cusack, a cagey but honest money manager, finds himself in trouble after his hedge fund collapses thanks to the pullout of his biggest investor. Burdened by a huge mortgage and pressing financial obligations to his family, Cusack goes against his better judgment and takes a job with Leeser Capital, run by the shady Cy Leeser, whose investment strategies have always been far from transparent. Cusack's misgivings grow as losses begin inexplicably mounting at Leeser amid rumors about the company's involvement in an Icelandic bank and a hedge strategy based on life insurance claims.

Covering the year 1962, the diary entries center on personal issues important to Jane Vivien (for the first time readers learn Moneypenny's full name), like her search for information about her father's mysterious disappearance in 1940. The Cuban missile crisis eventually looms large in a narrative slowed by copious footnotes. James Bond, still in mourning for his bride, Tracy, who died in a tragic car accident, acts surprisingly wimpy, except during a Cuban adventure when some much needed heat between Moneypenny and 007 is briefly generated.

{"title": "Family", "content": " Frazier, author of the best-selling Great Plains (Farrar, 1989), illuminates the recent history of this country by crisscrossing the nation to track down the names and stories of relatives as far back as his great-grandparents. Though at first the past seems as orderly as the listing of such simple details as births, marriages, and occupations, we soon move past now-peaceful graveyards to the roiled accounts of what real life was like for the people who joined the westward migration, fought in the Civil War, prospered in the oil boom, and suffered the untoward effects of progress. By weaving in his own circumstances as a young lad growing up heir to hardworking, pious traditions, Frazier converts what could have been merely a hearty retelling of popular history into a searching tale of parallels that solder together 130 years like links in the chain of life.

{"title": "Writing Home", "content": " Previously a bestseller in England, this eclectic collection of book reviews, essays and diary excerpts by screenwriter (The Madness of King George) and playwright (Single Spies) Bennett is a delightful blend of wit and intelligence. Bennett's writing career began in 1960, when he collaborated with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Jonathan Miller on the successful satiric review Beyond the Fringe. Diary excerpts from 1980-1990 document other theatrical and cinematic adventures and also describe, with Bennett's typical self-deprecating humor, his experiences in New York (he was mugged on the Lower East Side) and his trip to Russia with other writers. Bennett's social commentary on British politics and his critical articles about poet W.H. Auden, actor John Gielgud and playwright John Osborne are informed and perceptive.

As Mischa begins to investigate Martiya's life and supposed  crimes, he becomes increasingly obsessed with the woman. The complications that  arise have the potential to be riveting, but the chatty narrative voice takes  too many irrelevant detours to build much suspense. Still, Berlinski, who has  been a journalist in Thailand, vividly portrays the exotic setting and brings  depth and nuance to his depictions of the Thais.

Jones's joking about the various mental challenges of her crew may strike some as creepy in the context of their hunt for the \"ThreeFer\" serial killer.

Not for a century had U.S. forces' responses been so correspondingly ad hoc. Lynch, a retired master sergeant, is a marine of the old school who brought 23 years' experience as an infantryman to the problem. His solution was to create a convoy security force, the Majestic Twelve (which borrowed its name from the purported committee of scientists formed to investigate UFO activity). They were volunteers, individualists impatient with the routines of straight duty and bonded by a mission. The team made over 200 escort runs, never lost a man, and had a set of dramatic combat experiences and run-ins with higher authorities. Lynch, however, controls his narrative by blunt honesty about even his sexual urges after a fight. This is a useful addition to a growing body of Iraq War combat literature. 10 b&amp;w photos.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."}

He begins with the important commandment, And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. He convincingly claims that the Hebrew words for heart and soul have been severely mistranslated and should be rendered as mind and body. Similarly, Hoffman effectively demonstrates errors in rendering shepherd, my sister, my bride, two of the Ten Commandments, and virgin.

{"title": "Higher Education?: How Colleges Are Wasting Our Money and Failing Our Kids---and What We Can Do About It", "content": " Hacker, author of Two Nations: Black and White, Separate, Hostile, Unequal, and Dreifus, who teaches in Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, scathingly discuss the current state of American colleges and universities and argue that tenure and sabbaticals are outdated institutions that cost too much and serve poorly. The authors also claim that the cost of some schools and programs (medicine; sports) far outweighs the gain; teaching is a low priority, they say, blaming administration, committees, and amenities for the spiraling costs of Bachelor's degrees. Though they fail to mention how employment trends might affects students' choices, they do provide some suggestions for cost-cutting: reduce sports and travel of teams, kill tenure and reduce sabbaticals and research, and make medical schools and research centers independent institutions. While some good ideas can be pulled from the polemic, readers will be left waiting for a cool-headed, logical examination of our major institutions of learning. (Aug.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Alexei Korolev of the Moscow Militia's Criminal Investigation Division, who looks into the murder of a young woman found butchered in a church. Signs of torture suggest the killer may have been trying to get information out of the victim. Colonel Gregorin, an NKVD officer who takes an interest in the case, believes the crime has \"a political element.\" With Gregorin's help, the captain identifies the woman as an American nun, who may have been involved with smuggling valuables out of the Soviet Union for sale abroad. After a second similar murder, Korolev enlists the help of a motley assortment of allies, including a contingent of would-be Baker Street Irregulars and acclaimed writer Isaac Babel. Ryan, who merits comparison to Tom Rob Smith, makes palpable the perpetual state of fear of being reported as disloyal, besides dramatizing the difficulty of being an honest cop in a repressive police state.

Simon Zeile pursuing another sensational case. When chorus girl Annie Germaine turns up dead on a Manhattan theatrical stage, dressed in the outfit of the company's leading lady, Broadway impresario Charles Frohman asks the authorities to keep the tragedy as quiet as possible so the news won't affect the box office receipts. Next to Annie's body, which shows no marks of violence, is a cryptic note. Zeile soon learns that another actress, presumed to be a suicide, was found dead on another stage three weeks earlier, dressed up with a similar note next to her body. Certain that a serial killer is at work, the detective again consults criminologist Alistair Sinclair, who helped him investigate in the previous book.

Despite leading a high life both in Hollywood and abroad, Goddard, according to the authors, was not a celluloid damsel typical of her era: she was independent, unconventional and intelligent. A childhood that was impoverished educationally, emotionally and financially toughened her. Forced to drop out of school at age 14 to support her mother and herself, she married a rich husband who provided her with the first of the many \"settlements\" she would receive throughout her life. She was thus enabled to be professionally and socially selective and to ignore the intrusive demands of press and public. Although the biographers obviously admire Goddard, they have produced a routine and essentially superficial portrait. Readers will come away with lots of facts but an indefinite sense of this actress. Smart, charming, witty, down-to-earth, bejeweledbut is that all there is? Photos not seen by PW.

{"title": "Rebels and Traitors", "content": " Bestseller Davis (Alexandria) takes a break from her popular Roman historical mysteries with this sprawling epic of the English civil war. Alas, after the brief, moving prologue, which vividly depicts the final hours of Charles Stuart before his execution in 1649, the novel never again attains that narrative height. The action shifts to 1634, laying the groundwork for the conflict that culminated in the royal beheading and continues through the downfall of Oliver Cromwell's Protectorate in 1657 before a pat ending. Much of the action is seen through the eyes of a resourceful survivor, Gideon Jukes, a printer who ends up becoming a musketeer in one of the London Trained Bands, fighting for the Parliament against the king's men. Efforts to humanize the conflict by providing the bookish Jukes with a love interest don't amount to much.

Stockholm is overtaken by the undead after a period of strange weather, and the uprising has surprising consequences for several people, including David, a comedian whose dead wife comes back to life; self-harming psychic teenagers Flora and Elvy; and journalist Gustav Mahler, whose only hope of saving his daughter and himself from grief lies in exhuming his young grandson and hoping the boy will be reanimated. Lindqvist's character-driven narrative is at times slow and confusing, but pop culture references keep the story relevant and interesting. This intelligent look into the psychological side of the undead will entice longtime zombie fans eager for a subversive examination of some of the horror genre's most recognizable monsters.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Sleepwalkers", "content": " Set in Germany in the fall of 1932, Grossman's less than stunning debut features Berlin police detective Willi Krauss, who's become a minor celebrity, despite being Jewish, after cracking the notorious Child Eater case. As the Nazis plot to gain control of the country, Krauss looks into the death of a beautiful young woman found floating in the River Spree with her head shaved and her fibulas surgically removed from one leg and replanted in the other. Meanwhile, the Weimar republic's president, Gen. Paul von Hindenberg, orders the policeman to work on another case, the disappearance of a Bulgarian princess. Though the author does a decent job of conveying the atmosphere of fear as Hitler manipulates his way to power, clich&eacute;d plot elements, such as a hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold love interest for his hero, undercut his efforts at realism. Given the inherent lack of suspense (Krauss's detecting won't prevent the Nazis from succeeding), Grossman doesn't adequately compensate with complex characterizations.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Wu also includes a guide to Botox and other small-scale surgical interventions. The author is refreshingly honest and approachable. She enjoys having a tan, for instance, and doesn't see the point in telling her patients to wear long sleeves outdoors at any hour of the day. Though urging readers to eat organic, minimally-processed food is hardly a breakthrough, Wu's case for doing so is well-explained and easy to implement.

{"title": "Rubber Balls and Liquor", "content": " Comedian Gottfried goes for the jugular in his first humor book. As in George Carlin's Brain Droppings, the author loves to goof on language, and he is equally outrageous, as is evident when one deciphers the transsexual pun disguised in the book's title and the suggestive cover image. Gottfried free-associates, riffing in print with an improvisatory flair as wild as his standup routines. Blowjob and masturbation jokes punctuate a mix of memoir, angst-ridden anecdotes, and observational humor. Turning to self-mockery (\"I have a face for voice-overs\"), he tells how he landed the one-word role as the voice of the animated Aflac duck, and his fans will eagerly skip ahead to a chapter titled \"Too Soon\" about his now famous Friars Club performance two weeks after 9/11. Gottfried's basic tactic is to deliver a dynamite line and top it with several surprises before reaching the end of each paragraph, building to guffaw-inducing jokes on almost every page.

{"title": "Timemaster", "content": " Set in 2036, this latest hard - science novel by Forward ( Dragon's Egg ) deals with fringe physics and explores the exciting possibilities of relativity and quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, the author's characters and plot exist only as a pretext for his numerous, inventive gadgets and tricks. Protagonist Randy Hunter's astroengineering firm discovers a lifeform dubbed \"Silverhair,\" which contains negative matter rather than antimatter. By carefully engineering the Silverhair, Hunter and his associates develop a method of building starships that reach near-light speeds. Negative and positive matter are also used to produce gravity-balanced black hole masses, artificial wormholes, means of instantaneous travel, and, eventually, time travel. The scientific speculation is fascinating, well-researched and believable, but the heroes are cardboard, the villain a paper tiger, the plot a wish-fulfillment fluff of cotten candy.

But the sure-fire plotclearly based on Greenwood's knowledge of English historysinks under the tale's flimsy construction and fancy-Dan writing. As told by Dr. Watson, the story concerns a cryptic Elizabethan note belonging to the doctor's friend Aleck Raleigh. The centuries-old relic hints at a \"grate Tresur\" cached at Nightsead, onetime home of the quintessential swashbuckler Sir Walter, Aleck's ancestor. Watson excites the interest of the great Sherlock Holmes in the legacy, and Holmes tackles the puzzle and also investigates young Raleigh's stepfather and the lad's wife. The detective suspects either or both might kill for the secret he digs out (at last) from Nightsead's huge stone ruins.

His older son, slightly wounded at the same time, originally spoke of thieves who had broken into the house, but then confessed to having killed his father himself. A lengthy trial revealed that the father had abused his older son both physically and verbally, and that he also had mistreated his numerous wives. Much of the book, devoted to the first trial, is tedious in its over-attention to detail. That trial ended in a hung jury, but a later one convicted Ricky Kyle of involuntary manslaughter, and he is now serving a five year sentence. Finstad is the author of Heir Not Apparent.

Two very dissimilar women, Zoe and Leila, experience personal upheavals that leave them battered but unbowed. Zoe, the more conformist sibling, endures a lackluster marriage, bears two children and undergoes a divorce that forces her to become her own person. Leila, whose untrammeled bohemianism is compensation for her perception of herself as second-best, also faces the pain of a failed relationship and the challenges of single motherhood. Their parents' deaths provide an opportunity to consider that marriage, a moving aspect of this resonant novel, as the sisters cope with this separation in a way that clarifies their own attachments. 60,000 first printing; $60,000 ad/promo.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"title": "The Way Up from Down", "content": " Maintaining that depression is biochemically induced, temporary and treatable, Los Angeles psychiatrist Slagle presents a nutritional treatment utilizing amino acids and vitamin-mineral supplements that are available sans prescription in pharmacies and health-food stores. The author, who has a history of \"intense depression,\" readily admits that her alternative approach is controversial but, despite some awkward and repetitious prose, makes a solid case for food-mood connections. Readers are advised to self-test to discover if they are depressed by answering a number of questions, provided here. If they test as severely depressed, Slagle recommends that they seek a psychiatrist; others, she says, can embark on this self-help program alone. But the vagueness of the illness and the self-test questions, and the complicated nature of the treatment program, will deter readers, perhaps rightly so, from attempting this regimen without professional help. 25,000 first printing; major ad/promo; Prevention Book Club selection; author tour.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition."}

She's attacked by something inhuman and then learns her husband is dead. Fate intervenes in the form of the lone remaining servant, Mora, and her distant neighbor, Gabriel Wulf. Gabriel doesn't bring good news. He's been attacked on the road, and creatures lurk in the shadows, clearly targeting the Collingsworth estate and its inhabitants. And the creature within Gabriel stirs as the moon grows full. As Gabriel and Amelia's relationship develops in quiet contrast to the action, and Mora, Gabriel, and Amelia try to make their way to the safety of Wulfglen, Thompson adds a heaping dose of suspense to this entry in her Wild Wulfs of London series (The Dark One, 2005;The Untamed One, 2006).

{"title": "Blood of the Albatross", "content": " This second thriller by the author of Never Look Back has lots of potential but never manages to catch fire. The book opens crisply with the murder of a CIA agent in Germany who has passed information about a mole in the FBI to a courier, a woman agent who must evade capture. The plot turns sluggish when it shifts to Seattle where a middle-level FBI man becomes a pawn in a ruse to gain sensitive military secrets. Innocently caught in the intrigue is Jay Becker, a rock musician and sailor, who is hired to teach a young German woman how to handle a boat. Becker falls for the woman, an electronics expert, who, he learns, is being used by the spy ring to assess the material being received. The book is best when the author crosscuts back to Europe and the CIA courier's escape with the information, but the bulk of the action is padded, slowing the narrative pace.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Since controversies still rage over the historical accuracy of the various accounts of Earp's career, to describe Wyatt Earp as \"faction\" is perhaps the safest bet. As Braun describes it, Earp, while running for sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona, runs up against crooked politicians and lawmen. After brothers Virgil and Morgan are shot, Wyatt seeks revenge.

{"title": "Devil's Prize", "content": " Determined to match wits with Damien, the scandalous Earl of Falon, Alexa Garrick recklessly consents to meet him at the whist table. More than #90,000 in losses later, Alexa discovers that money isn't what Damien has in mind. Convinced that his brother Peter killed himself because Alexa had spurned the attentions of a \"penniless second son,\" Damien is determined to see that Alexa pays for his family's loss. The earl's suggestion that they meet privately to discuss her debt intrigues Alexa, as does the handsome earl himself. But when their meeting is observed and Alexa's reputation ruined, as he planned, Damien offers to marry her to protect her honor, deluding himself into thinking that a loveless marriage will be but another form of revenge. Martin's (Bold Angel) story is delightful and her character insights astute. Though Damien might easily have slipped into villainhood, the author rescues him with scenes that ring true-as when he visits Peter's grave with his mother. Martin also deftly manages the sometimes tricky task of injecting humor without compromising her characters or making them jokey.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Writing with Carter, who also collaborated with Ronnie Milsap and Ralph Emery on their books, Campbell recalls the grinding poverty he underwent as one of 12 children of an Arkansas sharecropper, the career he established playing backup for Frank Sinatra and Diana Ross, and his joining the Beach Boys at the height of their popularity, all before he made it on his own. As interesting as Campbell's story is, his book is disappointing, for his fundamentalism turns him to sermonizing against abortion, the banning of school prayer and the liberal press.

The nebulous laws aimed at settling land disputes between the Mexican Californios and the Americanos allowed some Anglos to steal vast quantities of California land. This story is about one such Anglo-Caralee McConnell's uncle-who has staked a claim to Rancho del Robles, the ranch owned for centuries by Ramon de la Guerra's family. Ramon, determined to \"set things right, to find justice with or without the Anglo law,\" fights back under the guise of El Dragon. A midnight raid on the ranch nets him Caralee, who becomes his unwilling hostage and later his unwanted bride.

Sometime in the 1990s, the happily married, happily pregnant Susan Butler is killed in an auto accident, but something happens on the way to heaven and Susan's soul is rerouted into the plump, alcohol-abused body of Margaret Johnsbury of Newport, R.I., circa 1888. As Margaret, Susan quickly learns, she is a vile, manipulative creature despised by everyone, including her husband, Carter. Ever optimistic, Susan puts herself on a diet, then sets out to mend her marriage and reestablish herself in society. Repairing Margaret's damage is not easy: she is shunned at social functions, Carter's family avoids her and Carter believes she is playing him for a fool again.

Garrick is much more intrigued by her companion, Lady Olivia Grey, who's married to his lifelong enemy, Arlen Grey, an evil man who brutalizes Olivia and her young daughter because both have ESP. As is often the case, these special powers tend to substitute for more banal, but also more meaningful, motivations. The lack of real sexual tension pulls down the plot, but it gains momentum when the long-lost Lionel suddenly reappears to claim his earldom, which raises the question of where he has been and even who he is.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

When a plebe at the Academy mysteriously falls out of a sixth-story window and dies, energetic Midshipman First Class Julie Markham, an acquaintance of the dead, is placed under scrutiny.

{"title": "My Scandalous Bride", "content": " As romance fans would expect from the star-studded lineup in this collection, each Regency-era novella features a high level of sensuality, but the short format of these pieces allows little room for romantic development. In the contributions from Dodd (\"The Lady and the Tiger\") and LaFoy (\"The Proposition\"), the heroines fall too quickly into bed with their respective heroes. Although the characters are likable enough, the stories lack the strong emotional core found in the authors' longer works. Still, there's plenty of fun to be had here. In Laurens's \"Melting Ice,\" for example, the heroine finds herself in the awkward position of having unknowingly invited herself to an orgy, and in Bradley's \"Wedding Knight,\" a bride becomes enmeshed in a mistaken-identity fiasco complete with blackmail and throwing knives. While this collection doesn't approach the heights any of these authors have achieved individually, it's consistent in tone and quality.

{"title": "Drood", "content": " Starred Review. Bestseller Simmons (The Terror) brilliantly imagines a terrifying sequence of events as the inspiration for Dickens's last, uncompleted novel,The Mystery of Edwin Drood, in this unsettling and complex thriller. In the course of narrowly escaping death in an 1865 train wreck and trying to rescue fellow passengers, Dickens encounters a ghoulish figure named Drood, who had apparently been traveling in a coffin. Along with his real-life novelist friend Wilkie Collins, who narrates the tale, Dickens pursues the elusive Drood, an effort that leads the pair to a nightmarish world beneath London's streets. Collins begins to wonder whether the object of their quest, if indeed the man exists, is merely a cover for his colleague's own murderous inclinations.

InThe Black Hole War, Susskind plays on our insatiable appetite for the gee-whiz moment, combining lucid explanations for some complex ideas with stories that tend to confirm the eccentricities of the highly intelligent. In fact, it&#x2019;s the author&#x2019;s knack for teaching and his conversational prose that make the book accessible and therefore appealing to a wide audience. And, of course, it&#x2019;s never a bad idea to drop Hawking&#x2019;s name in a book&#x2019;s title. &#x201C;Susskind explains this dizzying notion about as clearly as is probably possible,&#x201D; George Johnson writes of the author&#x2019;s theory&#x2014;even if, in the end, we need &#x201C;a lot more data&#x201D; (New York Times Book Review).Copyright 2008 Bookmarks Publishing LLC"}
{"title": "The 8th Confession (Women's Murder Club)", "content": " Fans of Sex and the City ripoffs may best appreciate Patterson's eighth Women's Murder Club novel, his fifth coauthored with Patero (after 7th Heaven). Det. Lindsay Boxer, of the San Francisco police department, is searching for a killer who's knocking off the well-to-do without leaving any signs of violence on the bodies. The investigation is going nowhere until the department's repository of institutional memory recalls a series of unsolved killings from 1982, in which the unidentified perpetrator used a krait, a rare Indian snake, to poison the victims. Meanwhile, Boxer's gal pal, journalist Cindy Thomas, is pressing the police to devote resources to a low priority murder-that of a homeless man known as Bagman Jesus, whose real name is a mystery. The romance that develops between Thomas and Boxer's hunky partner, Det. Rich Conklin, includes a striking moment when Conklin, magician-like, slips \"his hands into the flimsy fabric of her panties, making them disappear.\"Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "You've Been Warned", "content": " The Patterson bestseller factory has turned out another high-drama thriller, this time in collaboration withHoneymooncoauthor Roughan. Kristin Burns, a New York City nanny and aspiring photographer, is devoted to the two children under her care, but her desire for their father, Michael Turnbull, leads her to a risky, torrid affair with him. Kristin's anxiety about her guilty secret is heightened by a series of frightening nightmares centering on a vision of four body bags being loaded onto gurneys in front of a prominent Manhattan hotel. Her nightmares also feature recurring encounters with dead people, including her father and the pediatrician who abused her as a child. Kristin's breathless, superficial narration doesn't generate a lot of reader sympathy or interest in figuring out the source of her macabre experiences.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Digital Plague (Avery Cates)", "content": " This intense sequel to 2007'sThe Electric Churchis a strong techno-thriller, but it doesn't quite match its predecessor in originality. Avery Cates is a killer-for-hire who sold his services to the shadowy System of Federated Nations and destroyed the Electric Church's plans to turn people into cyborg Monks. Now mysterious assailants have infected Cates with a plague of nanobots that kills anyone he encounters and then reanimates the corpses. His condition draws the attention of the System authorities, who wonder why Cates himself has not fallen victim to the disease; they keep him alive in an effort to identify a cure. Amid sometimes flat scenes of gunfighting, betrayal and nanotech zombie uprisings, Cates's noirish narrative voice stands out as the book's real strength. Somers's compelling writing separates this from similar works and offers hope that future volumes will come closer to the quality of the original.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Doors Open", "content": " In Scottish author Rankin's intricately plotted heist thriller, software millionaire Mike Mackenzie, high-end banker Allan Cruikshank, and college art professor Robert Gissing devise a plan to liberate forgotten works of art from a warehouse storing the overflow from Edinburgh's museum collections. The trio commissions an art student nursing an antiestablishment grudge to paint fakes to swap for the originals, and Mackenzie's chance meeting with schoolmate Charlie Chib Calloway, now one of the city's most notorious gangsters, allows the group access to muscle and weapons. But cracks soon appear in the plan, with an inquisitive detective inspector, who's been on Calloway's trail for months, getting too close for comfort. Using the smalltown feel of Edinburgh to advantage, Rankin (Exit Music) gives his caper novel a claustrophobic edge while injecting enough twists, turns, and triple crosses that even the most astute reader will be surprised at the outcome.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Jolly Postman", "content": " This British import is great fun, sure to entertain children and parents alike. The Jolly Postman goes from home to home in a fairy-tale kingdom, delivering letters to such familiar addresses as \"Mr. and Mrs. Bear, Three Bears Cottage, The Woods.\" Every other page is an actual envelope, with a letter tucked inside. The letter to the three bears, for instance, is from Goldilocks, who apologizes for the trouble she's caused and invites Baby Bear to her birthday party. Some authors would stop with this cute concept, but the Ahlbergs have given this book their all. The story of the postman's travels is told in charming verse; the pictures are delightful, full of clever detail; and the results are frequently hilarious. (The wicked witch of \"Hansel and Gretel\" fame, for instance, receives a circular from Hobgoblin Supplies Ltd. which advertises such appealing products as Little Boy Pie Mix.)

The Locanos, a mob family, take in 14-year-old Pietro Brwna (pronounced Browna) after a couple of thugs gun down the grandparents who raised him in their New Jersey home. Bent on revenge, Pietro pursues the killers and executes them a year later. Impressed by Pietros performance, David Locano recruits Pietro as a hit man. After more traumas, Pietro tries to make a break from his past by entering the witness protection program. Now known as Peter Brown, he eventually lands a position as a doctor at a decrepit Manhattan hospital, where by chance a former Mafia associate turns up as a patient and threatens to rat him out.

{"title": "A World Without Islam", "content": " In this wide-ranging historical text, Fuller, former vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council at the CIA, suggests that many of the current tensions that exist between the East and the West have geopolitical rather than religious origins and that these tensions would have arisen in a \"world without Islam.\" The author opens the book with a theological analysis that emphasizes the continuities among the three Abrahamic faiths. He then pivots to an extended history of the Christian world that focuses on the conflict between Latin and Byzantine Europe, pointing out that the schism between them largely motivated the Crusades. The book then covers the relationship of Islam to Russia, India, and China before turning to the Muslim world specifically, surveying its centuries-long decline from a position of cultural, political, and economic dominance. Fuller covers an extraordinary number of subjects lucidly, and whether readers are persuaded by his valorization of geopolitics above religion, he cogently lays out the complex causes of contemporary conflicts and makes bold policy recommendations that move conversations about East-West relations beyond religious and ideological divides.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Company", "content": " Starred Review. This exquisitely written novel by a pseudonymous popular author blends gritty military fantasy with the 18th-century island story tradition. Seven years after the end of a war between unnamed countries, four friends who fought together have settled back into civilian life.  Then their former leader, Kunessin, now a celebrated and embittered general, turns up and reminds them of their old pledge to retire together to a peaceful island.  Better yet, he's found a suitable place and will fund the venture.  A local matchmaker finds women smart and desperate enough to be colonists, and they marry the ex-soldiers in a group wedding that sets the tone of the book: humorous, grim and utterly unromantic. The would-be republicans soon reach the island and settle in, but the discovery of gold in a stream changes everything.

{"title": "The Broken Kingdoms (The Inheritance Trilogy)", "content": " Starred Review. New authors often falter when following up on a noteworthy debut, but Jemisin proves more than up to the challenge. A decade after the events of March 2010's The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, artist Oree, blind to reality but able to see magic, sells trinkets to tourists in Sky, a city filled with supernatural entities and happenings in a world slowly emerging from doctrinaire authoritarianism. After she discovers the corpse of a murdered godling, Oree is pursued both by fanatic religious officials looking for scapegoats and by the ruthless conspirators behind the murder. Hesitant, impoverished Oree is very different from Jemisin's previous heroine, politician&ndash;princess Yeine, and she proves just as compelling as she investigates the murder and her own mysterious heritage.

Slowly, with patience and respect. Amory offers an entertaining, if precious, re-creation of his first year with Polar Bear (his account of selecting a name takes 20 pages). One highlight is a visit to the vet where the receptionist was a cat. During this time he also housed a dog and a grounded pigeon, and consulted a cat psychologist as well.

But that's where the clich&eacute;s end, for Marcus Wester would far rather guard humble caravans than cruel kings, and Cithrin bel Sarcour's loyalty is not to her long-dead noble parents but to the Medean Bank that took her in. Cithrin and Marcus must smuggle the treasury of the lost city of Vanai through a war zone in which every army seeks new sources of funds and every king wants them dead.

{"title": "Richard Burton: A Life", "content": " British author Bragg quotes extensively from Burton's notebooks in which he related his most private thoughts. The revelations will appeal to readers avid for gossip but they are more interesting as evidence of the late actor's writing gifts and of his literary ambitions. The biography, however, is heavily repetitious about the mutually obsessive loving and destructive Taylor/Burton relationship: their years in the international spotlight, their profligate spending and insatiable drinking; their extreme generosity to those in need. More affecting are reminiscences of Burton's Welsh family, his mentors Philip Burton and Emlyn Williams, friends and co-stars who share memories of the rise of a poor miner's son to world renown. There are also perceptive critiques of the star's successes on stage ( Hamlet , Camelot , Equus ) and in film ( Becket , Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ).

Still, Thomas remains disappointed in his son's lack of achievement or ambition, and Chris remains resentful that he's not accepted for who he is. A rather tired device, a bag of stolen money found by Chris and a friend and fellow former inmate, serves to set in motion a chain of actions that will lead to critical decisions for both Flynns.

Like many members of organized crime in his era, he became a specialist, working with casinos. He was rigidly honest about not cheating the public and paying his partners their due. His family life was a horror: Lansky's first wife became semi-psychotic and their three children had miserable lives; his second marriage was somewhat better.

{"title": "Pavlovsk: The Life of a Russian Palace", "content": " The Pavlovsk Palace, near Leningrad, has been a silent witness to the best and the worst fortunes of imperial Russia and the Soviet Union. Begun in 1777 by Emperor Paul III and his wife Maria Fedorovna near their capital, the palace was a residence of the imperial family until 1915. Preserved and protected during the Revolution of 1917, it was looted and nearly destroyed by the Germans during the World War II siege of Leningrad. Almost immediately after the siege was lifted (January 1944), plans were drawn up to rebuild and restore the palace to its former glory. Massie, author of Land of the Firebird (LJ 9/15/80), writes with great affection for the 18th-century builders and admiration for the contemporary artisans who have spent 40 years restoring the palace. A valuable addition for any travel or history collection dealing with the Soviet Union.- Marcia L. Sprules, Council on Foreign Relations Lib., New YorkCopyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Nature's Chaos", "content": " This collaboration by the eminent nature photographer and the recent author of Chaos: Making a New Science ( LJ 8/87) uses the photographer's observation of the \"random chaos of the natural world--a world of endless variety where nothing was ever the same\" to elucidate the new science. While reflections on the disorder of nature are eloquently articulated by both Gleick and Porter, the main offering is the selection of over 100 photographs, most previously unpublished, culled from a lifetime of work. Details and fragments are intermixed with landscapes, exploring the tension between order and chaos. Here are icicles, lichens, mosses, rocks, leaves, lava flows, clouds, cinders, even crab scratchings and flamingos, from far flung places such as Kenya, Uganda, Tan zania, Maine, Michigan, the Galapagos, Iceland, Antarctica, and Asia. What is revealed in this new book is more than the science of chaos--it is the wonder of this photographer's eye and artistry.- Ann Copeland, Champaign, Ill.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

{"title": "I Remember", "content": " CBS network anchor Rather ( The Camera Never Blinks ) has not had a particularly good press, but that may change with publication of this autobiography, written with the author of Bay of Pigs. Born in 1931 into a family headed by a blue-collar worker and living on the wrong side of the bayou in Houston, the future newsman grew up during the Depression and World War II; with his father steadily employed, there was no actual privation. As a youth Rather suffered a long siege of rheumatic fever, then curable only by bed rest, which ended his dream of becoming a football star. He had a large, interesting and supportive extended family, its members recalled affectionately here. The book takes Rather to his departure for Sam Houston State Teachers College in Huntsville, Tex., leaving material for a sequel. The general effect is warm and engagingly anecdotal. The style, however, is strange: it consists almost exclusively of short sentences with no polysyllabic words, as if to reinforce the impression that Rather is just folks.

Its sensuous prose and vivid rendering of the minutiae of everyday life propel the reader through three haunting tales woven together. They are the stories of two parents and two daughters in 1950s Philadelphia, a dollhouse whose inhabitants are not quite lifeless, and Edwina Moss, a 19th-century chatelaine of domesticity. The Philadelphia family's story is narrated by the elder daughter, who, infatuated with literature, peppers her narrative with sly allusions to Wuthering Heights (shutters banging, wind sweeping across the moors) and A Girl of the Limberlost. Strained marriages, details of housekeeping, anorexic daughters (both human and not), and the mysterious conflation of two paintings of Heaven and of Hell combine to demand rereading.

Under its presiding genius, Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson, the Skunk Works produced America's first jet fighter, the world's most successful spy plane (U-2), the first three-times-the-speed-of-sound surveillance aircraft and the F-117A stealth fighter. Rich was Johnson's right-hand man and succeeded him as director in 1975, retiring in 1990. In an entertaining style, the authors describe Johnson's tyrannical managerial style, his thorny but productive relationship with the Air Force and the stealth-technology breakthrough that revolutionized military aviation. Writing with freelancer Jonas, Rich also recounts Skunk Works' failures, including experiments with liquid hydrogen as a propellant and spy-drone flights over China's remote nuclear test facilities. He has much to say about the Defense Department bureaucracy and warns, \"Everyone in the defense industry knows that bureaucratic regulations, controls, and paperwork are at critical mass... and... in danger of destroying the entire system.\" This is a significant book for those interested in aerospace research and development.

{"title": "The Baby Book: Everything You Need to Know About Your Baby from Birth to Age Two (Revised and Updated Edition)", "content": " William and Martha Sears, a pediatrician and a registered nurse respectively, team up with two of their doctor sons to update their 1993 guide to \"attachment parenting.\" Advocating a \"high-touch style of parenting to balance the high-tech life of the new millennium,\" the authors teach new parents how to bond with their babies through seven fundamental behaviors, including breastfeeding, \"babywearing\" and setting proper boundaries. When parents keep close to their babies by bringing them into bed at night and picking them up when they cry, the infants develop better, the authors argue; rather than becoming spoiled, they become more healthy and independent. From tips for a healthy birth, getting your baby to sleep and feeding him the \"right fats,\" to information about early health concerns, the major steps in infant development and troublesome but typical toddler behavior, the authors of this comprehensive volume (who share their own parenting experiences along the way) are assured and reassuring experts.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Skyscraper Dreams: The Great Real Estate Dynasties of New York", "content": " Shachtman, coauthor of The Gilded Leaf , contends that skyscraper mania--the compulsion to alter and claim part of the New York City skyline and increasingly costly square feet of property--animates successors to the Astors and Rockefellers, represented by descendants of immigrant builders (Urises, Tishmans, Zeckendorfs et al.). While such people may assuage their oversize ambitions with well-publicized contributions to civic causes, many demonstrate a near-total disregard for the city's structural and social health--and, charges the author, for its real housing needs especially. Though a plethora of character sketches and anecdotes swells the narrative, history buffs and concerned citizens--and scandal- and gossip-lovers--should relish the stories of these dynasties. Despite the present financial crisis, the author predicts, they and New York City will survive. Photos not seen by PW.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

In 1922 he constructed the prototype of longitudinal psychological studies when he and his associates began the study of 1500 California children whose IQs were 135 or higher. With periodic follow-ups that remain active, the \"Termites,\" as they were dubbed, provided an enormous database that may not have disclosed the nature of genius but did prove one of Terman's points--gifted children become gifted adults. The research of academic Shurkin, given access to the guarded files on certain conditions of confidentiality, reveals some of the human stories of the Termites, less than half of whom are still alive. Not all felt blessed by the patronage of Terman, who is shown as paternalistic to a fault and wrong-headed regarding feminine and sexual traits and other important characteristics in his experimental group. Shurkin, who teaches journalism as Stanford and is the author of Intensive Care and other books, personalizes a landmark study.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

The nine-month Petersburg campaign was, in the author's view, the South's Gethsemane (\"the place where its moral character and its belief in its own righteous cause faced their ultimate testing\"). In masterly fashion Trudeau tracks the tactical struggle as Gen. Ulysses S. Grant seeks weak spots in Gen. Robert E. Lee's lines while Lee, forced to spread his smaller army ever more thinly, contests Grant's flanking movements in a series of hard-fought battles. Trudeau also provides vivid glimpses of civilian life inside besieged Petersburg and describes President Lincoln's visits to Grant's headquarters during the siege. The campaign reached its climax with Gen. Philip Sheridan's victory at Five Forks, followed by an assault on the Confederate lines which broke Lee's resistance. This oft-ignored major campaign of the Civil War receives expert examination here. Illustrations.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Templeton does a nice job of conveying the details of smalltown life, though her characters and their motivations are less well developed than those of such better-known writers as Ruth Rendell and Minette Walters.

{"title": "Magic Kingdom for Sale--Sold!

In his first non-Shannara novel, he takes on another well-worn premise: the contemporary Earthling transported to a fantasy world. Ben Holiday is a lawyer who finds little satisfaction in his work. His yearning for a simpler life seems thwarted when he finds the magic kinddom of Landover, a close analogy of Earth, with precariously balanced powers threatening each other, massive pollution, and general discontent centering on a lack of faith in leaders. This first volume in the new series is mainly introductory as Ben meets the locals and dashes off a few impossible tasks to assert his right to the throne. While still inventive, Brooks fails badly in his lackluster, unbelievable protagonist, his preachy moral tags and the adolescent, daydream quality of Ben's triumphs.

He shows that a succession of U.S. presidents and administrators coddled the archipelago's 60 or so ruling families, perpetuating the feudal oligarchy that continues to this day, and widening the gap between rich and poor. Karnow, whose Vietnam: A History is a standard account of the American venture in Southeast Asia, draws intriguing parallels: the U.S.-Philippine war of 1898, much like the Vietnam experience, dehumanized U.S. troops, who looted and annihilated villages; ex-President Marcos, like South Vietnamese ruler Diem, presented Washington with the problem of how to deal with a client state that squandered its credibility.

{"title": "Awakening (Gundam Mobile Suit #1)", "content": " Gundam is to Japan what Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are to the United States--an animated television series that became a cultural phenomenon. If this novel is any indication, the primary appeal of Gundam lies in its warrior robot hardware, specifically, the stet caps/pk Mobile Suits, which the author describes as \"giant, humanoid, heavy armor machines, a new type of weapon designed for close-quarter combat in outer space.\" The thin plot follows hero Amuro Rey as he blazes through space, defending the Earth Federation's interests against rebellious space colonies. There are references to serious issues (the environment, the pursuit of a higher level of consciousness), but mostly this is about battles, sophisticated machinery and firepower.

In addition to splendid lacquerwares and silks, which have shed new light on the artistic achievements of the early Han dynasty, the diggings have yielded a treasure house of manuscripts written on silk. Noted historian Yates (McGill Univ., Montreal) correctly likens the Mawangdui texts to the Dead Sea Scrolls in the West. The author has chosen to translate five Daoist texts, documents written to advise ruling Han dynasty authorities on how to attune themselves to the cosmos at a time of rapidly changing political and social climate. His work will be especially useful to students of classical Chinese because the translation is paired with the original text, and the entire work is painstakingly annotated and preceded by an illuminating introduction and commentary.

Starting with its founder, entrepreneur Warren Bechtel, who built roads, railroads and other major projects like the Boulder Dam (constructed in alliance with Henry J. Kaiser), this engrossing account by freelance journalist McCartney traces the growth of the engineering firm's international operations under the leadership of the son and grandson during WW II and after, when the company won contracts for ships, planes, the Alaska Pipeline and nuclear plants. The group's executives, McCartney contends, have filled or still occupy key posts in the White House, State Department, Pentagon and CIA, or have become CEOs of companies ready to further or protect Bechtel interests. The author also provides behind-the-scenes insights as to how the group covers up, if needed, questionable enterprises and conflicts of interest.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Accepting pain, the author asserts, is the first step toward healing. And although she describes the generally recognized stages of mourning, Brothers emphasizes that the intensity and duration of each stage vary greatly with the individual.

Maintaining that such relocation is inevitable, the author further argues that planetary science is of practical utility, fostering an interdisciplinary approach to looming environmental catastrophes such as \"nuclear winter\" (lethal cooling of Earth after a nuclear war, a widely accepted prediction first calculated by Sagan in 1982). His exploration of our place in the universe is illustrated with photographs, relief maps and paintings, including high-resolution images made by Voyager 1 and 2, as well as photos taken by the Galileo spacecraft, the Hubble Space Telescope and satellites orbiting Earth, which show our planet as a pale blue dot.

{"title": "A Woman's Worth", "content": " Williamson ( A Return to Love ) here tells women that they are goddesses with cosmic functions. A weakness: she often lets women hear what they want to hear--how \"special\" they are, how beautiful, how close to nature. When she draws from her own experience, Williamson gives sound, empowering advice on relationships, work, love, sex and childrearing. Still, her soft focus on the so-called feminine virtues, including that of assuming the submissive role during sex, often seems reactionary and contradictory, as when she argues that women were meant to be passive, but later claims that woman should assert their power. This mix of the mystical, the modern (Williamson says one of her old boyfriends left her for a \"bimbo\") and the Christian could be called visionary--but the combination doesn't always make sense, as in this statement: \"Our Kingdom is our life and our life is our Kingdom.

Connellpularization of Aquinas's system of the Nine Choirs of the Angels (Seraphim, Cherubim, etc.) does provide a paradigm of heavenly creatures, but the pedantic, choppy, pedestrian prose (e.g., \"Earthquakes are great teachers\") does not do justice to the rich mind and legacy of Aquinas.

{"title": "Forged In Honor: A Novel", "content": " Nearly nonstop action, engaging characters and vividly rendered locales distinguish this first-rate adventure tale by the author of The Iron Men. In the remote backcountry of Myanmar (formerly Burma), the fiercely independent Shan people, led by the Chindit (\"lion\"), preserve ancient customs far from the corruption of the ruling dictatorship. An extensive flashback shows the arrival, in 1960, of 11-year-old Kansan Joshua Hawkins in Burma, where he's gone to join his missionary family in Shan territory. Soon, Joshua meets young Stephen Kang, the Chindit's son; learning each other's ways and cultures, the boys form a binding friendship. Fast-forward to the present: Joshua, now a retired Special Forces colonel, and Stephen are thrown together once again-in a confrontation between sword-wielding Shan patriots and high-tech killers who traffic in heroin.

{"title": "Our Dreaming Mind", "content": " Inspirational imagery revealed in dreams to Muhammad, Gandhi, Descartes, Wagner, Handel, Coleridge, Yeats, Orson Welles, Elias Howe and many others has wrought significant changes in politics, science, art, music, film, literature and religion. Yet dreams have been devalued in Western culture, and one reason for this, suggests Van de Castle, is that Freud's forging of strong links among dreams, neuroses and sex has thwarted a wider exploration of the full meaning of dreams. Former director of the University of Virginia Medical School's Sleep and Dream Laboratory, the author explores the dream theories of Freud, Jung, Montague Ullman, Fritz Perls and others. He surveys the importance of dream imagery in ancient and non-Western cultures and crams in a wealth of information on children's dreams, recurrent dreams, nightmares, gender differences in dreaming and much else.

{"title": "New Passages", "content": " The author's previous blockbuster, Passages (LJ 5/15/76), introduced us all to the term \"midlife crisis.\" In this sequel, Sheehy takes us beyond the midlife crisis to examine later life stages, with a short update on young adulthood in the 1990s. In a few ways, this is a better book than its predecessor. Sheehy pays closer attention to the influence of history on the life course of individuals. She also addresses the main criticism that social scientists have made of her work?that large-scale studies have shown no evidence that most people go through the life stages that she describes?by explaining that people should go through these \"passages\" and that everyone who doesn't is \"walking dead.\" These improvements aside, her prose still sounds like that of a second-rate astrologer, her advice is often contradictory, and her adulation of famous personalities verges on embarrassing.

This prequel to the earlier books, presented as Belgarath's memoirs, offers an absorbing story line and some memorable characters as, once again, the authors touch all the right fantasy bases, with warring gods, political intrigues, supernatural creatures and appealingly human magicians involved in a titanic war over the course of seven millennia. Because of the vast scope, the sense of ages passing and of destiny unfolding is well conveyed; but that same scale confines the authors to handling some events and characters only briefly, and it mutes the story's emotional power.

Utah nuclear technician Ariel Behn receives a set of mysterious manuscripts from her Native American cousin Sam, who has narrowly survived their attempted theft. As possessor of the scrolls, Ariel finds her life in similar danger, especially after her company sends her to Russia with handsome, mysterious Wolfgang Hauser. During a torrid affair with Wolfgang, Ariel comes to suspect that he may be after the scrolls himself. At the same time, various members of her glamorous, far-flung family inform her that Hitler, Genghis Khan and the ancient Romans all sought the scrolls, which seem to hold the key to a secret power grid beneath the earth. Alternating family history with thorny historical passages, Neville brings the narrative back to Utah for a ludicrous wilderness showdown among the scrolls' pursuers.

Turning to blacks' \"self-inflicted genocide\" through drugs and street violence, he argues that white America shares a large measure of responsibility for this situation because it has fostered a racial chasm--a divide that seems likely to persist unless drastic steps are taken.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

While the murderer's identity may not be that surprising, the author's ability to convey the unrelenting sadness of his characters' lives and his deep psychological insights will satisfy those looking for more than mere thrills.(On sale Mar. 28)Correction:In the Q&amp;A with Alice Quinn that ran in our Feb. 20 issue, the photo credit should have read Robert Falcetti.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Spears of God", "content": " Hendrix's latest overstuffed near-future thriller (after 2005'sThe Labyrinth Key) tracks a multiparty global race to control various meteorites that may contain missing keys to human evolution, according to scientists Michael Miskulin, Darla Pittman and Susan Yamada. Hendrix wraps a high-stakes plot around this idea: a ruthless rogue army research group interested in using the power of the meteorites to develop super soldiers competes with religious zealots looking to spark world war three. But the author goes into detail about the scientific nuances of his concept at the expense of character development and pacing. Readers willing to wade through lists of government acronyms and thick scientific jargon explaining alternate-reality meteor science will find the action picks up a bit in the novel's last 50 pages.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Grapple (Settling Accounts, Book 3)", "content": " The compelling third volume (afterDrive to the East) in Turtledove's third alternate history of WWII series opens with the Confederacy reeling after the loss of their forces in the cauldron around Pittsburgh. The United States is trying to suppress the Mormon rebellion in Utah, while Canadian patriots fight the occupying Yanks to a stalemate. Negro guerrillas who escaped being swept up into death camps authorized by C.S.A. President Jake Featherstone disrupt the rural economy. Meanwhile, both sides work feverishly to win the race to build an atomic bomb. One may question the appropriateness of using the Holocaust as a springboard for an entertainment, but Turtledove convincingly depicts how an American holocaust could well have happened. Some Confederates begin to feel pangs of conscience, just as the U.S. troops who execute hostages among the Mormon, Canadian and Confederate civilians feel nothing but repulsion. While somewhat repetitious and a bit preachy in spots, Turtledove's latest proves that third time is the charm.(July)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Homeward Bound", "content": " Alternate-history maestro Turtledove's conclusion to his Worldwar and Colonization sagas, about how lizard-like aliens known as the Race invaded Earth during WWII and were fought to a stalemate by the major Allied and Axis combatants, lacks the vividly described battle scenes of its predecessors, but more than compensates by closely examining the Race's culture and society. While the Race have colonized much of Earth, they're amazed by the human ability to adapt to change. (The aliens' probe some 600 years earlier led them to expect they'd be facing armored knights.) When an American starship makes the trip to Home, the Race's planet of origin, the lizards fear the loss of their technological dominance and decide to annihilate Earth, their colony included...  The question of how much common ground exists between the lizards and humans wouldn't have been out of place in old issues ofAstounding.

In fact, he suggests a fairly hands-off approach, advising parents to simply not get involved in their children's bickering-related drama (unless there's danger of imminent harm). He grounds this methodology in three basic rules: don't take sides, act whenever you start getting irritated and never listen to what's going on. He also explains why siblings bicker (the number one reason: trying to get a parent on their side) and addresses many tangential aspects of childrearing (e.g., how to instill self-esteem). Through a mix of real and fictional anecdotes, the author not only provides persuasive arguments for his theories, but also gives parents ammunition through tried-and-true tactics (separation is a quick fix), turning the last half of the book into a very useful parental primer.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Although grownups are mature, says Wolf, they still retain a \"baby self\" that wants immediate gratification without stress. It is when someone's baby self, rather than rational self, emerges during a verbal conflict that trouble begins. Using numerous and often humorous sample conversations, the author demonstrates how to circumvent this. When Celia and Lewis disagreed because she had promised they would attend a dinner party and he wanted to spend time with his father, their discussion grew angrier because both used insulting language rather than accepting that they would have to negotiate. Just drop it, says Wolf, disengage and simply leave an argument if you and your partner cannot stick to the basic subject. Wolf (Mom, Jason's Breathing on Me) also includes sensible advice on how to avoid other baby self pitfalls. such as bringing up past grievances, assigning blame and indulging a need to control.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Here be dragons, beasts that can speak and reason, bred for strength and speed and used for aerial support in battle. Each nation has its own breeds, but none are so jealously guarded as the mysterious dragons of China. Veteran Capt. Will Laurence of the British Navy is therefore taken aback after his crew captures an egg from a French ship and it hatches a Chinese dragon, which Laurence names Temeraire. When Temeraire bonds with the captain, the two leave the navy to sign on with His Majesty's sadly understaffed Aerial Corps, which takes on the French in sprawling, detailed battles that Novik renders with admirable attention to 19th-century military tactics. Though the dragons they encounter are often more fully fleshed-out than the stereotypical human characters, the author's palpable love for her subject and a story rich with international, interpersonal and internal struggles more than compensate.(Apr.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Mercy Street (Mercy Street, Book 1)", "content": " This intriguing if somewhat bland first in a new romantic suspense series from bestseller Stewart (Last Breath) introduces two cool crime solvers, PI Mallory Russo, a former Conroy, Pa., cop, and Charlie Wanamaker, a former Philly detective who's returned to Conroy to help his alcoholic mother and his disabled sister. Despite bad experiences employing PIs, billionaire Robert Magellan, who's haunted by the disappearance of his wife and young son, hires Mallory to locate two missing teens, Courtney Bauer and Ryan Corcoran. The high school students vanished after a playground shooting that left two of their friends dead. The Conroy police suspect the pair were involved, but Mary Corcoran, Ryan's grandmother, and Linda Bauer, Courtney's mom, are sure of their innocence. Some readers may wish that the author had given more time on stage to a bad girl suspect, but all will cheer the appealing romance that develops between Mallory and Charlie.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Troy: Lord of the Silver Bow (Troy Trilogy, Book 1)", "content": " Starred Review. Bestseller Gemmell (Legend) boldly recasts the Trojan War in this first of a new trilogy, which centers on a warrior variously called Helikaon, Aeneas or the Golden One, who's blessed by luck to have all he turns his hand to prosper. Populated by compelling and finely drawn characters taken from either Greek mythology (Odysseus, Hektor, etc.) or the author's own fertile imagination, the novel lays the groundwork for the war to come. Spurred by prophecy, Agamemnon, King of Mykene, sets his men the task of killing Aeneas. The ensuing conflict threatens to engulf the Mediterranean. While this enchanting tale is more historical fiction than fantasy (the obligatory oracles and Kassandra's prophecies are the only hints of magic), genre fans and more general readers alike will have trouble putting it down.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Best of Lady Churchill's Rosebud Wristlet", "content": " Genre-blurring stories, poems and articles by a few major authors and a host of relative unknowns appear in this oddly compelling excursion into the realm of the surreal and interstitial. The standouts are a diverse lot: Nalo Hopkinson's exquisitely visceral folkloric allegory \"Tan-Tan and Dry Bone,\" Sarah Monette's darkly romantic \"Three Letters from the Queen of Elfland,\" the hilarious illustrations of Sara Rojo and narration of Lawrence Schimel in \"The Well-Dressed Wolf,\" Richard Butner's appropriately dry \"How to Make a Martini.\" Link and Grant also unabashedly include surprisingly sub-par examples of their own work. With a major SF imprint publishing this hefty anthology, LCRW's times as a low-profile fringe zine may be at an end, though it remains to be seen whether mainstream readers will be convinced to swell the ranks of its relatively few but utterly devoted subscribers.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Tales Before Narnia: The Roots of Modern Fantasy and Science Fiction", "content": " Adult/High School&mdash;This anthology includes stories, poems, and folktales that provided source material and influenced the writings of C. S. Lewis. Included are pieces by E. Nesbit, Hans Christian Andersen, Sir Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, Rudyard Kipling, and J. R. R. Tolkien. Some of these authors were widely read by Lewis and documented as such; others were chosen by Anderson due to story elements and passages that strongly resemble those within Lewis's work. In brief source notes preceding each entry, the editor speaks to the perceived influences. He also quotes passages within Lewis's work that appear derivative of, or at least inspired by, the earlier author. Similarities in allegory and metaphor, specifically theological in nature, are pointed out. Serious fans of Lewis's writing or those interested in his biography, emerging writers of fantasy, and students studying comparative literature or literary criticism will find this a provocative resource.

{"title": "Murder on K Street: A Capital Crimes Novel", "content": " Truman's 23rd Capital Crimes novel (after 2006's Murder at the Opera) offers little suspense and even less insight into the wheelings and dealings of contemporary Washington, D.C. One day, U.S. Senator Lyle Simmons, a presidential aspirant, arrives home to find his wife, Jeanette, murdered in their foyer. As the police investigate, fissures in the public facade of the Simmons's marriage appear, and Simmons's oldest friend, retired detective Phil Rotondi, who lost Jeanette to Simmons during college, wrestles with whether he should share all he knows about the politician with the authorities. Frequent flashbacks to those college days disrupt any narrative flow, and the florid and uninspired writing (\"Washington! Was there any other place in the world with as much intrigue on a daily basis, and with so much at stake?\") won't lead readers to confuse this mediocre thriller with the Machiavellian plotting of writers mining similar ground such as David Baldacci.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "El Borak and Other Desert Adventures", "content": " The late Howard (1906&ndash;1936) is best known for his sword-and-sorcery stories, but he was a prolific author whose work spanned many genres. This collection focuses on his Central Asian stories, offering 11 tales of derring-do along with various miscellanea and supplemental materials. Much of the book is devoted to Francis El Borak Gordon, an American caught up in the struggle among various imperial powers who seek control of the regions north of India. More self-centered adventurers like Kirby O'Donnell and Steve Clarney get fewer pages, but provide an interesting contrast with Gordon's loyalty to his friends of all races.

{"title": "Bryant &amp; May off the Rails: A Peculiar Crimes Unit Mystery", "content": " Starred Review. British author Fowler's outstanding eighth Peculiar Crimes Unit mystery (after 2009's Bryant &amp; May on the Loose) easily conveys the main characters' rich backstories in the course of a typically bizarre series of puzzles. In the previous book, the PCU, spearheaded by elderly senior detectives Arthur Bryant and John May, apprehended the King's Cross Executioner (aka Mr. Fox), who beheaded his victims, but failed to keep him in custody. In making his escape, Fox killed a police constable. In order to continue being funded, the team now has a week to recapture the fugitive. A series of mysterious events in the London Underground may also be Fox's work: the fatal fall of a single mother down a flight of stairs and the disappearance of a drunken social engineering student after boarding a late-night train.

{"title": "The Confession: A Novel", "content": " Grisham's recent slump continues with another subpar effort whose plot and characters, none of whom are painted in shades of gray, aren't able to support an earnest protest against the death penalty. In 2007, almost on the eve of the execution of Dont&eacute; Drumm, an African-American college football star, for the 1998 murder of a white cheerleader whose body was never found, Travis Boyette, a creepy multiple sex offender, confesses that he's guilty of the crime to Kansas minister Keith Schroeder. With Drumm's legal options dwindling fast and with the threat of civil unrest in his Texas hometown if the execution proceeds, Schroeder battles to convince Boyette to go public with the truth--and to persuade the condemned man's attorney that Boyette's story needs to be taken seriously. While the action progresses with a certain grim realism, Schroeder's superficial responses to the issues raised undercut the impact. As with The Appeal, the author's passionate views on serious flaws in the justice system don't translate well into fiction. (Oct.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Sugerman ( No One Here Gets Out Alive ) tells of his well-heeled yet troubled childhood and of his association, begining at age 12, with the Doors, particularly his relationship with the band's nihilistic leader, Jim Morrison. Himself experimenting with drugs at the time Morrison OD'd, Sugerman developed an addiction, at the same time assuming more responsible and more visible positions with the Doors' organization. The author describes in wrenching detail his increasingly outrageous behavior which, because it was equalled or exceeded by his friends and associatesseveral of whom died during this periodwas perceived within his milieu as, if not normal, at least acceptable. Fortunately for Sugerman, he stopped his wild rush toward self-destruction just short of its realization.

Newspaper reporter Fletcher (Almost Heaven: Travels  Through the Backwoods of America) spent two years traveling  around the country and getting a feel for its land and people.  What he discovered right away was that almost all of the people  he met, even the extremists, were friendly, honest, and  talkative. This gave him (and he in turn gives readers) some  insight into the politics and everyday life of Northern Ireland.  This is a compelling portrayal of the gorgeous landscape, the  sad history, and the warm and enduring people of the country.

{"title": "An Age Ago: A Selection of Nineteenth Century Russian Poetry", "content": " This newly translated anthology of 11 19th-century Russian poets will both delight and educate readers interested in Russian literature and history. The poems are accessible today primarily because they focus on such universal metaphysical and private issues as love, time, aging, jealousy, war, nature and death. Lyrical, strictly structured with traditional rhyme schemes and meters, the verse is an unusual combination of Romantic language and subject matter and rational theory stemming from the Age of Enlightenment. The anthology balances political, philosophical and personal poems nicely, and the selections complement each other, displaying the individual styles of the authors as well as their common concerns. The poets represented range from the well-known Aleksandr Pushkin and Mikhail Lermontov to the less familiar (to Americans) Prince Vyazemsky and Nikolai Yazykov. The translation is skillful, retaining both the formal aspects of the original verse and its colloquialisms. Brief biographies of the authors are included. This fine anthology is marred only by its slimness: enticed readers will wish for a more comprehensive selection.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Blood, Class, and Nostalgia: Anglo-American Ironies", "content": " Author and journalist Hitchens, Washington editor for Harper's and a columnist for The Nation, sees empire as a binding theme of the \"special relationship\" between Britain and the United States, and Britain's canny attempt to \"play Greece to America's Rome\" as a controlling factor in the relationship. Hitchens examines critical points in American history and politics since 1898 to demonstrate his points. America's love of royalty and long love affair with Churchillian rhetoric have created popular support of what Hitchens sees as very much an alliance of aristocracies, with class a key element. The book is somewhat disorganized and often pointlessly sarcastic, but on balance it is a thought-provoking overview of an interesting and significant topic.

{"title": "The Collected Stories", "content": " Though Michaels, who died in 2003 at the age of 70, is probably best known for his novelThe Men's Club(1981), these 38 stories attest to his skill as a short story writer. Readers coming to Michaels's work for the first time will find the early, pointed stories from his noteworthy collections,Going PlacesandI Would Have Saved Them If I Couldas well as some of his later works that have never been collected. Michaels's early stories are written with a frantic sexuality that displays his distinctive dark humor. In \"Fingers and Toes,\" recurring characters Henry and Phillip weigh the value of their friendship against their encounters with the same woman through a set of urban hallucinations characteristic of the early stories. Raphael Nachman, the icon of Michaels's later fiction, is an aging mathematician at UCLA and a surprising foil to Michaels's usual kinetic energy. In the first Nachman story, the professor takes a guest lectureship in his ancestral Poland and tries to reconcile his analytical yet peaceful view of the world with his family's history.

{"title": "The Magus of the North: J.G. Hamann and the Origins of Modern Irrationalism", "content": " Revered by Kierkegaard as a genius, German thinker Johann Georg Hamann (1730-1788), a Lutheran pietist, counterposed God's will and direct revelation to the shortcomings of science and secular liberalism. In this absorbing if unconvincing study, Berlin portrays Hamann as \"the first out-and-out opponent of the French Enlightenment,\" a forerunner of Nietzsche and the existentialists in his defense of the intuitive and the concrete against the hyperrational, generalizing, scientific West. In his opposition to reason, his anti-intellectual identification with the masses and his attacks on Jews, Hamann fueled the irrational currents that culminated in Nazi hysteria, charges Berlin. Nevertheless, the author, a distinguished historian of ideas, believes that Hamann's original views on creativity, language as a system of symbols and the hazards of abstract thought command the attention of readers willing to tackle Hamann's digressive, dense and flowery prose style.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Mrs. Ike: Memories and Reflections on the Life of Mamie Eisenhower", "content": " This sympathetic and competently crafted biography of President Eisenhower's first lady is written by her granddaughter, founder of the Center for Post-Soviet Studies (Breaking Free: A Memoir of Love and Revolution). The Eisenhowers were married for 53 years and, despite the difference in their backgrounds (she was wealthy, while his family struggled financially), according to the author, they were devoted to each other. Because \"Ike\" had embarked on an army career, Mamie (1896-1979) had to adjust to a life of constant moves and separations. Drawing on letters and conversations with Mamie, the author chronicles her long career as an army wife and gives a brief overview of the White House years. Included is a moving account of the tragic death of Ike and Mamie's young son. A traditional wife, Mamie focused on homemaking and, although disturbed by rumors of her husband's affair during WWII, she believed his denials. The author discounts rumors of Mamie's alcoholism, blaming her supposed instability on inner-ear problems. Photos not seen by PW.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Mirroring People: The New Science of How We Connect with Others", "content": " How do we know what others are thinking and feeling? Why do we weep at movies? UCLA neuroscientist Iacoboni introduces readers to the world of mirror neurons and what they imply about human empathy, which, the author says, underlies morality. Mirror neurons allow us to interpret facial expressions of pain or joy and respond appropriately. Thanks to these neurons, Jacoboni writes, [w]e have empathy for... fictional characters&mdash;we know how they're feeling because the feeling is reproduced in us. Mirror neurons also help us learn by imitating, from newborns who instinctively copy facial gestures to adults learning a new skill. The author cites studies suggesting that when mirror neurons don't work properly, as in autism, encouraging imitative behavior, or social mirroring, can help. More ominously, Jacoboni sees mirror neurons as implicated in addiction and finds possible implications for how we react to consumer and even political ads. Iacoboni's expansive style and clear descriptions make for a solid introduction to cutting-edge neurobiology.(May 21)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "My Father, His Daughter", "content": " Few 20th-century leaders have captured the world's imagination as did Moshe Dayan. The Israeli general's victories were legendary; and, as minister of foreign affairs, he was one of the architects of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. Yet, his personal life was marked by notoriety. His numerous publicized affairs and his reputation for aloofness and arrogance were common knowledge. In this moving and honest portrait of her father, Dayan brings to life the brilliant general and the difficult man. Dayan, herself a noted author, describes as well her own life and turbulent yet loving relationship with her father. The final chapters deal with the mixed reactions of Dayan and her brothers when, under the terms of their father's will, they were virtually disinherited in favor of Moshe Dayan's second wife. Overall, the book is not only a fascinating memoir, but an intimate and significant history of Israel. For most libraries. Andrea Caron Kempf, Johnson Cty. Community Coll.

He paints an unflattering portrait of the great artist, while revealing his own relationship with Dora, Picasso's mistress. Picasso and Dora are not the whole subject of the story, however; Lord is really the main character. His impressions, homosexuality, and life are just as much the subject as Picasso and Dora. And his probing the mystery of Dora, though insistent, finally uncovers more mystery, although it may shed some light on an assortment of friends and acquaintances who are mentioned but given no real substance. Those interested in Picasso, Paris, and modern art will want to read this book. -- Ellen Bates, New YorkCopyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Early Jewish peddlers and farmers tried to eke out livings in the mountains, but, by the 20th century, Jewish resort owners flourished--touting fresh air and serving co-religionists spurned by gentile establishments. Yiddish superstar Boris Thomashevsky initiated entertainment in the region when he brought a troupe of actors to vacation with him. Later, singers like Eddie Fisher and Jan Peerce were launched there. Satirized by Jewish and secular newspapers, as well as by their own self-abnegating comedians, the Jewish Catskills became a symbol of bourgeois bad taste vis-a-vis food, sex, fashion, spouse hunting and social climbing. Today, once posh resorts now in decline have become condominiums, or serve nonkosher food to woo gentiles.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

He ran an orphanage for Jewish children and acted as a beloved father figure right up until he and the children perished together in Treblinka. Bogacki's picture-book biography is heartfelt and well researched.

As a result, Korczak doesn't come across as the fascinating man he was, and the book is a bit confusing. Bogacki's childlike illustrations seem wrong for the dark subject matter and dark scenes, particularly since most children don't learn about the Holocaust until fifth grade, and these pictures seem too young for that audience.&mdash;Heidi Estrin, Feldman Children's Library at Congregation B'nai Israel, Boca Raton, FLCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The subtitle at first seems misleading, for populism by its very nature was a political movement. However, by emphasizing populism's social roots, the author conveys the idea that populism was much more than the political party. Instead of studying populism from the top down or analyzing it from the viewpoint of the 1890s, when it seemed to be at high tide, McMath turns to its historical roots in rural communities, before it became a powerful national political movement. The result is a clear synthesis of the latest research, valuable for general readers interested in the nature of grass-roots politics as well as for professional historians. with an interest in a major American protest movement.- Charles K.

For example, the Germans' newfound freedom, as Schneider shows, has complicated the romances of lovers who once navigated the Wall's restrictions. For the most part, though, the author ( The Wall Jumper ), who lives in Berlin, grapples with weightier issues in this ironical, witty report. He cites \"the two good reasons\" to fear a reunified Germany: resurgent anti-Semitism and the questionable stability of German democracy. He explores how people are coping with the chaos of events, with the mass influx of refugees from East Germany and of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe. Whether he is exposing the exploitation of 60,000 Vietnamese slave workers in the old Democratic Republic or assessing the failure of both left and right to come to grips with socialism's demise, Schneider is a penetrating and astute critic.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Lynch's winefoolery is serious; drollery never compromises his knowledge of his subject or his high standards.

He laughs at trends in wine consumption, and singles out modern greed as a corrupter. Effortlessly eloquent, Lynch is a master of the brief barb: \"Loving Chablis is like falling in love with a frigid floozy.\" The author prefers a wine that offers \"a subtle seduction; it keeps you coming back for more.\" So too with this unusual guide: it makes you thirst for a sequel.

Juxtaposed to this trend is the breakup of the Congress Party's hegemony and the subsequent growth of regional political parties. With the ebbing of congressional power and the elimination of its Socialist economic constraints, the Indian economy has embraced greater growth as the number of Indians living below the poverty line diminishes. Khilnani attributes much of this growth to India's cities, which emerge as paradoxical points of exclusion and economic dynamism when compared with rural India. In the process, national identity has in Khilnani's vision been subsumed by regional political focuses, urban and rural divisions, and greater religious identification. Hence, India's future will necessitate the continuance of a viable democracy sustaining the economic, cultural, and social diversity of the subcontinent.

In a world that is, on the one hand, worried by carbon-dioxide emissions but, on the other, consuming ever more copious amounts of electricity, a simpleminded antinuclear stance will not suffice. Nearly one-fifth of the world's electricity is supplied by nuclear plants. The authors essentially instruct readers about three things: how nuclear bombs explode, how nuclear reactors operate, and options for disposing of or reprocessing radioactive material. The fairly technical text is written clearly and is free of advocacy, although the authors ultimately urge the revival of the American Baruch plan of 1947, which proposed turning over all bombs to an international agency. Their preferences aside, the authors' objectivity makes this a public-spirited book that will aid any reader who wants to know more about nuclear energy.Gilbert TaylorCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

Although he is attracted to business executive Valerie, he has trouble engaging her in small talk. However, when they return to Paris, their relationship quickly turns passionate as they explore sadomasochism and public sex. Michel talks Valerie and her business partner into marketing sex tours to the Third World, selling them on his theory that Westerners have lost touch with their own sexuality.

With a simple, short explanatory text and some 200 photographs (approximately 100 in color) of nursing mothers, the author of The Complete Book of Pregnancy and Child birth sets out to dispel fears about breastfeeding and conveys practical advice about positioning the baby, interpreting the baby's sucking rhythms, maternal nutrition and breast care. The most valuable parts of the book, however, are not on honing \"technical skills\" but those that treat aspects of the intimate communication between mother and baby--during breastfeeding and beyond. Kitzinger encourages the mother to involve the father in the burdens of infant care--as well as the rewards of nurturing--and to link up to a supportive network of women with children who can share both her positive and negative experiences and help her to maintain perspective during the emotional first months of a baby's life.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

{"title": "Eleventh Month, Eleventh Day, Eleventh Hour: Armistice Day, 1918, World War I and Its Violent Climax", "content": " A tight focus&mdash;the activities of the British and American troops on the final morning of WWI&mdash;has yielded a somewhat sprawling study for Persico, who coauthored Colin Powell'sMy American Journeyand whoseRoosevelt's Secret Warmade the cover of several book reviews. Some soldiers laid down their arms and waited quietly for 11 a.m.; others suffered heavy casualties (a total of about 10,000) because aggressive commanders (including General Pershing) insisted on launching assaults right up to the last minute. Incidents of the final morning are sandwiched between an episodic overview of the Anglo-American experience on the Western Front (to the detriment of other nations and theaters of war) and capsule biographies of prominent and ground-level players in the war. The narratives of battles are something of a mixed bag, but more than commonly readable for the lay reader. Although not satisfyingly organized, the book is a good introduction to what it covers for new students of WWI.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Vintage Book of Amnesia: An Anthology of Writing on the Subject of Memory Loss", "content": " Amnesia is an illusive subject that many artists have pursued, particularly literary artists. And like most things hard to get, its suitors are legion. Haruki Murakami's \"The Fall of the Roman Empire, the 1881 Indian Uprising, Hitler's Invasion of Poland, and the Realm of Raging Winds\" exhibits the utterly evasive nature of memory and is emblematic of the razor wit of these contributors. Lethem has mined a rich field for this splendid collection of short stories and turned up such authors as Julio Cortazar, Jorge Luis Borges, Philip K.

{"title": "Mom's Marijuana: Life, Love, and Beating the Odds", "content": " With some touting marijuana as a palliative to chemotherapy's side effects, which the author smoked as he combated Hodgkin's disease, one might expect Shapiro to explore the controversies surrounding the issue of grass-as-medicine. Besides briefly relating how his mother cultivated hemp in the backyard, he never allows the subject to impinge on his potpourri of cancer survival memories. Diagnosed at age 20 with a tumor, Shapiro details the biopsies, I.V. drips, radiation sessions, and blood draws alongside his characterization of the doctors, technicians, and nurses who managed his care. Interleaved with this commentary about the antiseptic quality of modern hospitalization are Shapiro's deeply drawn recollections of growing up and pursuing a career in psychology. Regrettably this volume lacks a thematic linkage to Shapiro's myriad memories of dreams, his walk along the precipice of death, and his amour. Nevertheless, the book's origin as NPR pieces and the author's lectures to oncology organizations will most likely generate interest.Gilbert TaylorCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

A masterful stylist who captures the untamed energy of the West in every inflection, Stegner paints word pictures of the landscape full of dry clarity. He has \"Western migratoriness\" in his blood, as revealed by autobiographical sketches tracing his peripatetic childhood from an Iowa farm to North Dakota wheat towns to Washington logging camps. In a deeply moving confessional letter to his mother he measures his life against his unspoken promises to the woman who died 55 years earlier.

In the wake of a racially charged incident on their home turf, the team goes on to beat their crosstown rival, sparking racist reactions both from the opposition and local authorities.

Tracing events from the colonists' unexpected outrage over the 1765 Stamp Act to the Treaty of Paris in 1783, he describes the bitter foreign policy debates in London and the escalating logistic difficulties of supporting a war in North America while conducting far-flung campaigns against the French and Spanish as well. In his evenhanded account of operations from Canada to the Carolinas, Hibbert analyzes British attempts to achieve a unified strategy against the rebels, and brings into focus the ideological confusion and political disunity that hampered the American cause throughout the eight-year struggle. The author lays more stress on French intervention in accounting for the ultimate American triumph than our historians are wont to do.

{"title": "Call to Duty", "content": " This engrossing, character-based thriller by the author of Firebreak divides its time between the present day and WW II. In the present, a feared drug-smuggling organization kidnaps the daughter of powerful Sen. William Courtland, planning to use her as leverage against U.S. narcotics agents. Courtland, who cares less about his daughter than his career, pressures President Matthew Pontowski to order a Delta force raid on the smugglers' home base. Either way the senator wins: if his daughter is saved, fine; if she's killed in the raid, Pontowski loses face and Courtland is positioned to win the next presidential election. Faced with this dilemma, Pontowski reflects on his experiences as a downed RAF pilot making his way across occupied France during WW II. The two plots mesh well in a briskly paced narrative. Herman's characterizations are fluent and convincing; he depicts combat, both past and present, with involving realism, and his sparing use of gore makes those scenes which contain it all the more effective.

Their book considers 20 or so Supreme Court cases, the verdicts of which pivot on one of the first Ten Amendments to the U. S. Constitution. The cases chosen are not the landmark, precedent-setting ones with which most people are familiar. Instead, readers will find normal people who, because of circumstance, victimization, or character flaws, end up having their stories studied by the highest court in the land. As the authors acknowledge, \"It is a fair summary of history to say that the safeguards of liberty have frequently been forged in controversies involving not very nice people.\" Several life histories read more like soap operas and B-movies than a law text. The writing is clear, direct, and often poignant. There are photographs of some of the protagonists that add to the down-to-earth character of this study. Finally, it is entertaining.- Vicki Fox, R.

{"title": "Durable Goods", "content": " In Berg's understated and promising fiction debut, a 12-year-old \"army brat\" comes to epitomize the quality that her father prizes: emotional durability. Narrator Katie lives on a Texas Army base with her 18-year-old sister and volatile father, an officer of unidentified rank. The girls' mother has died of cancer, although Katie never discusses how much time has passed since the loss. Accustomed to a military lifestyle, suspecting that her home will be only a temporary one, Katie leads a fairly ordinary existence. She and her best friend go swimming, talk about puberty and meet boys. When the inevitable happens and the family learns they're being transferred to Missouri, Katie tries to accept the impending change, but her sister, who can no longer tolerate her father's abuse, rebels. Direct, matter-of-fact sentences convey resilient Katie's point of view; the absence of a maternal figure is acutely felt, particularly in the vulnerable but violent father's frightening temper. Overall, however, this subdued tale of a troubled family is more modest than memorable, insinuating rather than fully examining its characters' motives.

Similar hard work is just as essential in changing human behavior, especially addictive behavior, according to the authors. Changing for Good distinguishes itself from the many other self-help materials available by espousing a sound therapeutic approach based on the authors' years of professional work with people in all sorts of damaging behavioral patterns, including smoking, overeating, alcohol abuse, and toxic relationships. The six steps to change, the social processes one must understand while changing, and the criteria used to measure success will prove useful to all self-helpers.

The volume ends in 1949, with Morrow's acceptance of Cleary's first novel, the now-classic Henry Huggins (initially written as a short story entitled \"Spareribs and Henry\"). The author's unsentimental recollections of herself as a student in the Depression, a librarian and a newlywed are told humorously and candidly. Friends and adversaries-her ever-critical mother, formidable professors, congenial classmates, gentlemen acquaintances (including future husband Clarence)-are as colorfully sketched as the characters appearing in Cleary's beloved novels. Able to laugh at her own mistakes and to recognize universal truths in everyday life, Cleary will endear herself even more to her fans with this account of her struggle for independence.

{"title": "Eyewitness to History", "content": " This unusual 700-page anthology of eyewitness accounts invites readers to dine with Attila the Hun, gaze on daffodils with Dorothy Wordsworth, attend Gauguin's impromptu wedding to a Tonga girl and roam Africa with Stanley as he searches for Livingston. Carey, an Oxford professor, author of books on Dickens and Donne, had one criterion for inclusion of the selections: good reportage. Jack London describes a 1906 earthquake (\"San Francisco is gone!\"); Darwin interacts with friendly birds on the Galapagos; Walt Whitman records Lincoln's murder. The best writing, on balance, is by random observers rather than paid journalists. Some caveats: the selections lean heavily to war, misery, disasters; there's an overemphasis on British and colonial history; haphazard headnotes range from skimpy to nonexistent. These complaints aside, this collection (published in England as The Faber Book of Reportage ) is endlessly fascinating; its firsthand reports of acts of courage, cruelty, intolerance, discovery and simple pleasures burn indelible images into the mind.

{"title": "What Do You Really Want for Your Children?", "content": " Well-known pop psychologist Dyer ( Your Erroneous Zones ) coaches parents in raising ``no-limit'' (emotionally healthy) children. In an admittedly repetitious but highly readable style, he covers topics like risk-taking, living in the present, self-reliance, and creativity. Each chapter includes strategies, negative child/parent behaviors, and the support systems (``payoffs'') for maintaining desirable behaviors. Dyer's message (directed at kids, but meant for everyone) is sometimes philosophical, often opinionated, and definitely motivational. The catch is that neurotic parents (the majority, according to the author) must first become good role models. Nevertheless, the book has much to offer, especially about reinforcing attitudes of physical ``wellness.'' First serial rights to Ladies Home Journal .

{"title": "Jason's Gold", "content": " Grade 5-8-Fifteen-year-old Jason first hears about the discovery of gold in the Klondike while working as a paperboy in New York. He quickly rushes to Seattle to meet up with his brothers, only to find that they have left for the Yukon without him. As he goes the trip alone, adventures pile up. Fighting bears, shooting rapids, and even a crazed moose can't stop him from joining his brothers. Author Will Hobbs (Morrow, 1999) threads Jason's travels with actual historical figures, including Jack London. Also, sprinklings of actual events of the gold rush give listeners an idea of the difficulties encountered. Boyd Gaines is up to the task of narrating Jason through each adventure. His steady, but excited voice adds extra suspense to each dramatic event. Voice changes between characters are minor, though Gaines does manage to make one minor character sound like Jimmy Stewart.

{"title": "Michael and Natasha: The Life And Love Of Michael ll, The Last Of The Romanov Tsars", "content": " In 1908 in prerevolutionary Russia, the czar's brother Grand Duke Michael fell in love with married commoner Natasha Wulfert. If fate had been kinder, they might have been the first in a line of Romanov constitutional monarchs. Instead, Michael spent ten years battling for acceptance of their marriage and working to convince the czar that his repressive policies were driving the country to revolution. The subtitle calls Michael \"the last of the Romanov Tsars,\" a title usually reserved for his brother Nicholas II. Technically, Michael was the last, simply because Nicholas abdicated in his favor shortly before both were murdered in 1918. This book is not only history but the tragic love story of a couple trying to be together and still fulfill their obligations to the country they loved. The authors, both journalists, have crafted a compelling, well-researched account of an aspect of Russian history not widely known.

{"title": "Ufo Crash at Roswell", "content": " The alien spacecraft that allegedly landed in Roswell, N.M., on July 3, 1947, was not the product of rancher Mac Brazel's imagination, say the authors of this report of the event, pieced together from accounts by 200 witnesses. The book contends that the sighting was hushed up for years by the U.S. government (Sen. Davis Chavez allegedly ordered the local press to keep quiet about the incident), and the remains were explained to be weather balloon parts. Those who had any information about the event were sworn to secrecy, and Brazel himself is said to have accepted a new truck in return for his silence. The inability of scientists to identify the material constituting the metallic debris is offered as evidence of an alien visit. The authors even claim to have an otherwise skeptical NASA official believing their version of the story. Though comprehensive, this account is weakened by the repetitious presentation of the facts.

{"title": "The Total Cat: Understanding Your Cat's Physical and Emotional Behavior from Kitten to Old Age", "content": " Wilbourn has been a feline behaviorist and therapist for more than 20 years, practicing in partnership with various veterinarians in New York. Here she provides good general information about the care, feeding, and medical needs of cats, but the real strength of the book lies in her discussions of cat behavior. From the selection of a cat by its age and personality type, along with suggestions for finding a good match for the character and lifestyle of the potential owner, to fitting a cat into a household that may include other pets to causes and cures of less desirable feline behavioral traits, the author covers all aspects of cat behavior. How to discriminate between a cat displaying an unusual but normal reaction to stimuli, like drooling when very happy, and a behavioral disorder, such as over-aggression, are clearly defined in easy-to-understand language. Books that base the care of companion animals on an understanding of the basics of their behavior are extremely welcome additions to the cadre of how to books on pets, and Wilbourn's offering will be an excellent addition to any collection.Nancy BentCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

{"title": "One True Love", "content": " The nice little life that account executive Lisa Alvarez has spent the last eight years constructing is about to fall apart. She's due to marry her boss in barely a month when painful reminders of her dead baby daughter and her ex-husband Nick Maddux force themselves on her. Both Lisa and Nick have tried to make new lives for themselves since the baby's death, although Nick has embraced his daughter's short life by becoming a master craftsman of cradles while Lisa has simply shut the door on her past. Their reunion is fiery, passionate and difficult to read, in part because Lisa is not a congenial character, having turned herself into a career-driven robot. The story veers between Lisa and Nick's rediscovery of their love and the burgeoning love of Nick's sister, Maggie, and sexy screen writer Jeremy Hunt. Maggie and Jeremy are both attractive and deserved more length and breadth than author Freethy (Daniel's Gift) gave them. A magical leitmotif throughout does, however, go some way towards transcending these weaknesses.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Here he concentrates on the careers of Garth Brooks, Wynonna Judd, and Wade Hayes to show what it takes to get to the top in Nashville's country music world.

By day, Dorsey is a teaching assistant in the sociology department of the local college; by night, she's Mack, bartender at Drake's, a swank men's club; and in between she's Lauren Grable-Monroe, pseudonymous author of a runaway bestseller titled How to Trap a Tycoon (? la How to Marry a Millionaire). Adam Darien, publishing tycoon of Man's Life magazine, hangs out at Drake's and will do anything to find out who Grable-Monroe really is. Dorsey (as Mack) defends Grable-Monroe's book by arguing that if Adam's magazine celebrates all the nice things that men have, why shouldn't women have the same things by finding a wealthy tycoon willing to provide them? And so the gender war begins. Though the interior monologues have an annoying way of chopping up the dialogue and Dorsey and Adam's more contentious arguments are often repetitive, Bevarly's vibrant characters and playful language make her book an exceptionally engaging read.

{"title": "Fidel: A Critical Portrait", "content": " With Castro's cooperation (which included many hours of taped conversation), interviews with scores of his friends and associates, and access to Cuban archives, this former New York Times foreign correspondent has produced the first major biography of one of the most puzzling and little-known world leaders of our day. Material includes an analysis of Castro's relationship with the Cuban Communist Party before the revolution, details on the CIA's initial support and later assassination attempts, and convincing suggestions on how the Bay of Pigs affair led directly to the Cuban missile crisis. The author characterizes the Cuban revolution of the 1960s as \"to a very large degree the story of Fidel Castro's and John Kennedy's impact on each other.\" Szulc's admiration for the Cuban leader is vast: Castro is \"a virtuoso of politics\" and \"a master of strategy and tactics as well as a master of timing.\" So rich is the material Szulc marshalls in his support that readers less enamored of Castro will find it hard to deny these and other sweeping statements.

Miller tells youngsters a bit about her and how she came to accomplish this feat. Her subject's story, like many tales from the \"forgotten West,\" is a fascinating one; however, the narrative is choppy, jumping from incident to incident, and impersonal. Fields does not emerge as an individual of substance. Readers get very little sense of her life as a person of color, or as a woman living a nontraditional lifestyle. The finely detailed, watercolor-washed illustrations provide some texture to the account, as they beautifully capture the subject's expressions at significant moments, but the backgrounds are oddly flat.

{"title": "The Salad Days", "content": " The actor's stylish, gently humorous autobiography recreates Hollywood in its early glories, but it is even more appealing as the story of an extraordinary life and career. Fairbanks, son of the screen's definitive swashbuckler and stepson of Mary Pickford, \"America's Sweetheart,\" relates incidents that deeply affected him after his parents' divorce in 1917 when he was seven. There are stories about the author's famous friends (Olivier, Edward G. Robinson, Noel Coward, etc.) and lovers (Gertrude Lawrence, Marlene Dietrich and others), as well as a portrait of his first wife, Joan Crawford. It is particularly interesting to follow the steps related here in Fairbanks' career, starting in the silents of the 1920s (Stella Dallas) and continuing in the talkies that brought him starring roles in Little Caesar, The Prisoner of Zenda, Gunga Din and other epics of the 1930s.

Pointing out that it has been primarily women who have changed their attitudes and behaviors during the past 20 years, the authors see the initial move toward sexual liberation as an important early expression of feminism. However, as they trace its evolution through the institutionalization of new attitudes, they also show how the revolution has been co-opted by both the Christian Right and the sexual marketplace. Now, in the wake of AIDS, a new sexual conservatism encroaches, which encourages women to return to the old values. An essential purchase for most libraries. Beverly Miller, Boise State Univ.

{"title": "Louis XIV: A Royal Life", "content": " Animated by well-chosen quotes from diarists of the period and the author's enthusiasm, this biography is as captivating as Secrets of Marie Antoinette and Bernier's other praised works. The life of the Sun King is described with immediacy from his birth in 1638, after an unexpected meeting between his alienated parents. Louis XIV inherited the throne when he was five at his father's death. As regent, his mother, Anne of Austria, and her minister, Cardinal Mazarin, targets of a \"great cabal,\" held onto power precariously, perhaps influencing the young ruler's determination to govern personally, which he did until he died in 1715. The Grand Monarque's reputation still stands on his reign, rich in art and literature, his brilliant court and invincible armies. Bernier's admiration is balanced by accounts of the king's moral lapses and multiple adulterous affairs. Perhaps his worst failing was his persecution of non-Catholics: not only reprehensible but an error that crippled the economy when thousands of Protestants fled the country.

{"title": "Spanish Table", "content": " Wine connoisseurs may recognize the Torres name as that of a Spanish winery, and, indeed, the author represents the family firm in North America. Here the amateur gourmet cook concentrates on the cuisine of her native country, offering recipes that illustrate its intriguing variety. Dishes such as chicken in orange and mint sauce or sweetbreads in a honey and sherry vinegar sauce reflect an Arab influence. Some offerings, like bean stew with sausages, Asturian style, readily display their local origins while others, including veal medallions in orange sauce and stuffed rabbit saddle with vegetables, subtly modify regional influences into strikingly modern and elegant dishes. While a few recipes come from the Torres family, many originate with professional chefs. A number of entrees require lengthy preparation, including one or two wines (often fortified) as ingredients. However, the clear instructions that reduce procedures to smaller, less daunting stages may encourage cooks to experiment. Given the author's background, readers will be disappointed that the wine chapter emphasizes growing regions rather than practical suggestions for serving Spanish wines with the dishes in this book.

{"title": "Royal Sunset: The European Dynasties and the Great War", "content": " Brook-Shepherd's 12 previous books established his reputation as a historian with the talent for clarifying extremely complicated events. Here he reports little-known facts on follies and tragedies that made the First World War inevitable. He shows why only England survived as a monarchy after the \"Great War\"; the others were doomed long before 1914, when the assassination of Austria's crown prince triggered the hostilities. The author describes manipulations by rulers in Serbia, Bulgaria and Montenegro, the power plays that contributed to the juggernaut. There is new light shedon Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm, who emerges here as feckless rather than determined on war as usually claimed and terribly jealous of his uncle Edward VII and cousin George V.

{"title": "Queen Dolley", "content": " A \"biographical novel\" or \"fictionalized biography\" stands astride two distinct if not opposed genres and is likely to slump somewhere between. This one, by the prolific author of some 25 history-based novels, portrays postRevolutionary America in a pedestrian, reportorial style that gives it factual accuracy and smothers it in exhaustive detail but does nothing to provide the breath of life. President James Madison's regal lady Dolley is portrayed as a bustling, tireless whirlwind and sustaining force. We are told rather than convinced, that she is a charmer, an infinitely accomplished hostess and peacemaker. Stouthearted through the War of 1812, Dolley saves Gilbert Stuart's portrait of George Washington from the burning White House, courageously enduring the crises and ordeals of the infant nation. While hardly a standout, the book is well timed in anticipation of next year's Constitution bicentennial celebration.

{"title": "The Life Extension Weight Loss Program", "content": " Durk and Sandy (as they refer to themselves throughout the book), authors of Life Extension and The Life Extension Companion, theorize that fat metabolism, not caloric intake, is the reason some people are less successful in converting food into muscle instead of fat. They explain that the ability to produce growth hormone (GH) decreases with age, and GH controls the body's ability to convert fat to muscle. To replace this natural GH deficiency, the authors suggest GH diet supplements in the form of such amino acids as arginine, ornithine, niacin, methionine or tryptophan and a minimal exercise regimen. They also advise suchdietary modifications as consuming carbohydrates with a low glycemic index (that don't significantly raise blood sugar levels) and foods that increase thermogenesis (and burn fats, carbohydrates and protein in your body). This guide will undoubtedly spark interest in many who want to lose weight with virtually no change in lifestyle or eating habits but may ultimately benefit only those who understand technical, medical explanations. Other readers will find themselves lost among the amino acids. Illustrations. 100,000 first printing; author tour.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

In a candid and informal narrative accompanied by large, often full-page color photographs, the author recreates dramatic moments of their life with Daisy, a young giraffe. Daisy's adjustment to the Leslie-Melville estate is difficult until she imprints on Jock as her foster \"mother.\" Surprisingly, her need for love and attention parallels that of a young child. She even exhibits sibling rivalry when a second giraffe joins the family. Melville provides an unusual look into the world of the giraffe, an animal that at first appears aloof and indifferent, but in reality is quite loving.

{"title": "Firefighters: Their Lives in Their Own Words", "content": " Smith, author of Report from Engine Co. 82 and editor of Firehouse magazine, has interviewed firefighters around the country, professional and volunteer, male and female, in big cities and in small towns, and here reports their observations about their careers. What shines through most consistently is their altruism: they love their work and not the least of the reasons for that affection is the opportunity they have to save lives, or at least to do good. Another strong element is camaraderie: firefighter after firefighter mentions the sense of family that each feels, a feeling almost as strong as that for the biological family. There are accounts of choosing firefighting as a career, the baptism of fire, firehouse life and, in a really harrowing chapter, details of some of the worst blazes. The book is as moving as it is informative. Photos not seen by PW. $75,000 ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

At least the authors (a pharmacist and his wife) recommend at the beginning of the book that the reader should be guided by a \"qualified health professional\" in taking these nutrients or drugs.

Fletcher Randall, a college student at Princeton in 1855, has lately arrived from the North Carolina plantation where his family's many slaves were treated well, but \"knew their place.\" Through friendship with the Ellis brothers, fellow-students and Quakers committed to the anti-slavery cause, Fletcher's new perception of humanity wrenchingly alters his relationship with his uncomprehending family. Once he enlists in the Underground Railroad by partnering Harpin' John, a plantation slave, in a daring Christmas Eve escape, Fletcher's future is irrevocably cast with his Northern, Quaker friends.

Los Angeles freelance journalist Rappleye and private eye Becker trace the rise of this gangster who began his career working for Al Capone, moved to Hollywood at a time when the mob was making inroads into the film industry, switched his residence to Las Vegas when the first Cosa Nostra-financed casinos were built, and played a major role in the CIA's abortive attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro. The book draws a deeply depressing picture of American life with its contention that many important figures in business and politics are beholden to the Mafia, including John Kennedy, who, the authors suggest, was killed by the mob.

Father and son here pool their considerable talents in a spoof of the confessional genre popularized by disaffected adult children of media personalities. Although there are zany highlights in the son's recollection of being a miniature reproduction of \"Daddy\"--down to duplicate Gold Toe socks--the humor becomes strained. While Chris recollects what it was like being his father's 10th son and the only one not named Bob Jr., Dad offers chapter-by-chapter rebuttals, noting that \"places, events and situations have been changed to make the story more palatable.\" David Letterman provides a foreword to this collusion of comedians who are satirists as well as relatives.

{"title": "Mind, Fantasy &amp; Heal", "content": " When Epstein, a wife, mother and graduate student in sociology at the University of Massachusetts, learned in 1985 that she was ill with kidney cancer, she was advised by her doctor to expect only a few more months of life. But after embarking on an intensive program of \"psychosynthesis\"--a psychological approach to self-healing involving therapy, meditation, \"visualization\" and dream analysis--she found that her tumors decreased, and she has remained cancer-free for the last three years. Here she documents a process of self-discovery and spiritual growth (\"The mind that heals also has the power to destroy\") in response to the tragic initial prognosis. To dispute her assertions is difficult, for Epstein's story is amazing, often moving. But it is so intensely personal that a reader must question the author's confidence in recommending her recovery techniques as standard practice in treating cancer patients.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "The Congressman's Daughter", "content": " Harlow Pearson, twice U.S. Representative from Vermont, is a fly fisherman, a gambler, a womanizer and a father. Since his love for daughter Alexandra never exceeds his overwhelming need for control, it's not entirely surprising that her pregnancy at age 19 should result in parental strictures that still obtain two decades after Harlow's death. Alexandra's story is related by her father confessor, a friend who lives down the road a piece. Maneuvered into marriage by the terms of her father's will, Alexandra struggles to keep her spirit intact while her husband, Bryce, hand-picked by Harlow, looks for ways to twist her arm \"a little, just to keep her in line.\" To do so, Bryce even threatens to turn his smalevolence toward the child. Eventually, his wife takes sanctuary from his bluster and lies by rekindling an old love affair. A dry, credible bitterness pervades this latest novel by the author of The Good Son. Its hesitant tone and emotional distance are the calculated result of having the story told by an observer, a device that works only up to a point.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Elvis And The Colonel", "content": " Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker were associated in the public mind like Laurel and Hardy, although a more accurate pairing would have been Svengali and Trilby, as the authors demonstrate. Intriguingly, the colonel, who projected an image as American as apple pie, was foreign - born (in 1909): a Dutchman named Andreas van Kuijk, he served in the U.S. peacetime army but never became a citizen. He entered the U.S. illegally and as a young man worked in carnivals, where he learned to be a con man par excellence, according to the authors. It was his talent as an operator that led him to become the personal manager of Eddy Arnold, then Hank Snow and finally Elvis. While the authors do not attempt a psychobiography, they argue forcefully that Parker's carnival background made him a conniving money-grubber who eventually destroyed Presley's career. The singer himself does not emerge here as a hero, but he does seem more to be pitied than censured.

{"title": "When You and Your Mother Can't Be Friends: Resolving the Most Complicated Relationship of Your Life", "content": " In her well-researched study freelance journalist Secunda draws on 100 interviews with grown daughters in which they describe early painful relationships with their mothers, protracted in their adult emotional lives and memories. To help repair the damage done to the psyches of daughters whose mothers are characterized as, for instance, the Avenger, the Doormat, the Smotherer, the author suggests a measure of separation from the mother--\"divorce\" if need be--designed to rid the daughter of guilt, restore her self-esteem and prepare her for her own motherhood. Secunda advises daughters to forgive their fallible mothers, \"who did the best they could,\" and attempt a balance based on generosity and self-preservation. Nevertheless, this study tends to treat daughters as hapless victims, underestimating the pressures imposed on mothers of yesterday and today.

Book 2 of a planned trilogy takes readers along on Randall's quest, as she hopes to find a state or time (like that of the title's dragonfly suspended in a piece of amber) where Fraser still exists. This imaginative novel suffers somewhat from the author's overuse of personification (\"spectacles gleaming with concern and curiosity\") and her confusing switches between the two first-person narrations, which sometimes cloud an otherwise intriguing adventure.

The poetry has become more ``literary'';  the illustrations--without the particularity of the earlier  portraits- -show archetypical Native Americans with extravagantly  flowing hair afloat on fields of intense color. Both poems and  paintings are beautiful in their way, but their mannerism is no  match for the concreteness and immediacy of the earlier work.

The authors admit this is \"a celebration of a show we place among the finest . . . \" in TV history. Well, that could be open to argument. It is true that most of us probably do remember Mary Richards, Mr. Grant, Rhoda, Phyllis, Ted, Murray, et. al; and, yes, most cast members and writers went on to other things, some rather stellar (among them writer James Brooks of Terms of Endearment and Broadcast News fame.) But when the authors rhapsodize about the show and its meaning, the reader's eyes begin to glaze over. However, fans will appreciate that all episodes are described, giving date shown, guest stars, writer and director, as well as a story synopsis and insider's comments on the making of it. There are also painstaking details and incidents surrounding the creation of the show.

It provides an interesting, if almost too comprehensive, account of day-to-day life for members of one of the most popular bands. Beginning with his subjects' arrival in Berlin to record an album as the Wall was coming down, Flanagan presents U2 as residing at the heart of politics and social change, describing their friendships with Bill Clinton and Salman Rushdie, their extralegal activities on behalf of Greenpeace and their efforts to provoke their massive audience into greater awareness through such projects as nightly updates on the war in Bosnia. Flanagan also encourages band members to spout off their philosophies on everything from music to religion and politics.

Mr. Roth and his young neighbors Duane and Justine have built a Sukkah to celebrate Sukkoth, the Jewish festival of thanksgiving. But when the holiday begins, a hot wind breathes spreading brush fires into the Oakland hills. As flames engulf whole neighborhoods, hundreds of people must evacuate to nearby shelters. The Roths' pain is heightened when they cannot bring ther cat, Tikvah, to safety. When the families finally return home, they find only rubble. But the Sukkah, miraculously, stands unscathed. And, in another bit of good fortune, Tikvah also turns up. Polacco's ambitious story tries hard to accomplish many objectives. The combination of varied elements results in a rushed tone and uneven pacing, so that the religious or spiritual aspect seems particularly forced.

Laetitia Letty Talbot, a neophyte archeologist, turns detective while visiting Theodore Russell, an authority on Crete's history who's determined to find the tomb of the Greek god Zeus on the island. Letty dislikes Theodore but befriends his frail wife, Phoebe. Soon after, Phoebe hangs herself, an act so out of character that Letty joins forces with the local inspector to probe deeper. When the autopsy reveals that Phoebe was pregnant and Theodore could not have been the father, Letty finds a range of potential suspects in the potential fathers-to-be.

On her first night in the City of Light, she's badly injured during a terrorist attack, after which she is left with no memory and no choice but to rebuild her life with a new perspective on her career, family and personal relationships. Steel flirts with themes of motherhood, second chances and writing, never settling on any one for long as Carole discovers the importance of pursuing her own desires while being generous to others and of keeping the men she wants in her life close but not too close. The best part is Carole's rehabilitation; as she reacquaints herself with family and friends, Carole the patient shows the patience author Steel lacks to probe beneath the surface.

The paucity of clues leads the inspector to take the unconventional step of recruiting a new prosecutor, Rebecka Martinsson, to the team. Martinsson's single-minded devotion to her work is of great benefit to Mella, whose inquiries into the self-made founder of Kallis as well as the victim's brother lead her to believe that the motive for the brutal crime stems from Kallis Mining's unscrupulous business practices.

In this irresistible thriller full of deceit, duplicity, and vengeance, British author Goddard (Name to a Face) shifts effortlessly between 1976, when 68-year-old Eldritch Swan, thought killed in the Blitz, resurfaces from 36 years in an Irish prison, and 1940, when Eldritch, a cocksure secretary for an unscrupulous Antwerp diamond merchant, Isaac Meridor, prepares to leave for America. The older Eldritch, who appears as weird as his given name implies, assures his nephew, Stephen, he'd been framed in Dublin for unspecified offenses against the state, though he admits to helping steal Meridor's Picasso collection. Eldritch needs Stephen's help to prove the collection rightfully belongs to Meridor's wife, daughter, and granddaughter, Rachel Banner.

But secrets in Polly's and Gretchen's pasts, as well as a rivalry between Polly and Liv over Nick, quickly snowball into Nick's disappearance and two deaths. As told by Polly, Nick, a detective named Morris, Gretchen, and Liv, the ambitious tale presents difficulties in sorting out reliable voices and events from a clutter of peripheral characters and impressionistic storytelling.

The cultural icon's programs dominated TV in the 1950s, and even today reruns of The Honeymooners wipe out the competition, notes Time magazine culture critic Henry, who expertly analyzes the performer's acting on TV, on stage and in film.

The book presents diverse sentiments from those who knew him well, suggesting that he presented many different guises. Or, as a close friend quoted here concludes: \"The truth is, I don't know if I ever met Jack Gleason. I know I met some portrayal of him.\" Photos not seen by PW.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Total Impact", "content": " Lott played with the San Francisco 49ers throughout the '80s, placing him on four Super Bowl championship teams. He was also chosen to play in the Pro Bowl nine times in 10 years, testimony to his excellence as a defensive back. Yet, his successes notwithstanding, readers may question whether this ponderous tome, coauthored with Sports Illustrated senior writer Lieber, may not be overkill. While fans will enjoy the book's game-by-game analysis of the 1990 season, in which the 49ers failed to reach their third straight Super Bowl, even the most fervent Lott admirers will little care that in his karate lessons he does 1000 kicks or consider it a revelation that he likes to hit opposing players hard, a point made at least a half-dozen times.
