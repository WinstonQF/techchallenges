{"title": "A Guidebook to Learning: For a Lifelong Pursuit of Wisdom", "content": " Adler passionately believes that most people, even those with college degrees, have not really acquired the skills necessary to explore the world of ideas. To document his argument that people are not systematically educated and that overspecialization is rampant, the author (Ten Philosophical Mistakes takes us on an A-to-Z romp through encyclopedias, card catalogues and university curricula. Such thinkers as Aristotle, Bacon, Coleridge and Spencer have wrestled with the problem of how to organize all human knowledge. The core of this challenging, if peculiar, \"guidebook\" surveys some 20 thinkers in two- to four-page sections. Adler attempts to provide tools to make the leap from information to organized knowledge and wisdom. His proposal to map current disciplines includes an \"outline of knowledge\" that helped revolutionize the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and an \"index of great ideas\" embodied in the Great Books of the Western World series. Philosophy is restored as queen of the sciences in Adler's scheme, and poetry turns out to be philosophy's handmaiden.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "The FOUR DIMENSIONS OF PHILOSOPHY", "content": " Adler's central thesis, in this concise, lucid survey, is that philosophy not only ranks on a par with science as a means to knowledge, but also claims superiority over science in certain areas, for example, in telling us what ends we ought to pursue. The prolific author of Six Great Ideas equips the armchair thinker with a road map to Western philosophy's peaks, abysses and abiding questions as he underscores the pitfalls to be avoided, and fruits to be won, in pursuing four distinct philosophical realms--metaphysical, moral, objective (i.e., understanding of ideas) and categorical (understanding of subjects). Adler's approach ranges widely, moving from \"disorders\" of medieval thought to the modern \"political illnesses\" of nationalism, tribalism and xenophobia. This invigorating introduction to how philosophy works emphasizes the importance of philosophical introspection in the lives of ordinary men and women.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

{"title": "People of the Sea: The Search for the Philistines", "content": " Were the Philistines uncouth, violent, dull-witted barbarians, as the Old Testament portrays them? Definitely not, argue the authors, both professors of archeology and history in Israel. Drawing on 40 years of their own research and synthesizing information from a century of archaeological digs, the Dothans reconstruct the complex material culture of the Philistines, a seafaring people who settled on the coastal plain of Palestine after being defeated by the Egyptians around 1200 B.C., and who subsequently fought violently with the Israelites. As revealed in more than 100 drawings and photographs, the Philistines were accomplished architects, sophisticated urban planners, highly artistic potters, weavers and ivory and metalworkers. A civilizing force, they sat before Aegean-style hearths, practiced elaborate religious rituals and cremated their dead. This intricate account moves the Philistines from the mists of myth onto the stage of history.

The drama of the triocollege students Michael Schwerner and Andy Goodman, both white Northerners, and James Chaney, a young black activist from Mississippipits their faith in nonviolence against a murderous rage fueled by racism. Cagin and Dray, who coauthored Hollywood Films of the Seventies, have done their homework: interviews, news reports, FBI documents and trial transcripts undergird their brilliant re-creation of the incident, interwoven with a full-scale history of the civil rights movement. The search for the bodies turned up many black corpses, purported victims of police/Klan violence; the Klan conspirators were paroled before serving their full sentences; in the aftermath, Lyndon Johnson questionably maneuvered to defuse the situation. This is surely one of the best books on the civil rights movement.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

He covers a lot of ground with anecdotes about appearing on talk shows, his acting and writing experiences in the theater and making personal appearances, along with snippets on some 19 personalities with whom he has worked, including Art Carney, Jackie Mason, Bill Murrary and John Belushi. The longest section devoted to a single topic is of Grodin's roles in the movies, particularly in his newest film, Heart and Souls. Covering as many topics as he does, the author provides readers with little substance, and in many respects this volume appears to be a collection of items he left out of his earlier books.

{"title": "What's Wrong With Your Life Insurance", "content": " A standard \"cash value\" life insurance policy will pay its prescribed death benefit in any year the prescribed premium is paid up, and the premium usually is reduced eventually to zero by an ever-increasing annual \"dividend.\" Nevertheless, in this updated version of a controversial 1963 title, Dacey ( How to Avoid Probate! ) denounces the insurance industry as a whole for misusing policyholders' money. Huge surpluses from lapsed policies, investments and favorable mortality experience, argues the author, finance exorbitant executive salaries and agent compensation. He sees deception everywhere in the modern insurance world of policies combining mortality charges with a savings/investment program. The variety of such formulas is almost infinite, their complexity confusing to the prospect they are meant to fool (and to the reader), as Dacey demonstrates exhaustively.

TV reporter Harris (Dying to Get Married) relates the tragic story of 16-year-old Tina Isa, murdered in Missouri in 1989 by her father, Zein al-Abdeen Hassan Isa, with her mother's help. The father, from a backwater Palestinian town on the West Bank, was a suspected member of the terrorist Abu Nidal organization, and his home in St. Louis had been bugged by federal agents. Thus the murder was taped, and the parents received death sentences. The proximate cause of the slaying was Tina's attempted assimilation into American culture?her wanting to become independent, to get a job, to date an African American teenager?but the root causes, according to the author, lay in the misogyny of Islam and in the clannish nature of rural Palestinian society, where the \"honor\" of the family is more important than life itself.

{"title": "Haing Ngor: A Cambodian Odyssey", "content": " Ngor spent four years as a \"war slave\" under the Khmer Rouge, experiencing severe torture, losing most of his family and posing as a former cab driver when in fact he had been a doctor. His account of what amounted to a living nightmare vividly conveys the extent of organized savagery that held sway in Cambodia from 1975 until the invasion by the North Vietnamese. Some of the details are so ugly that in three places the author suggests that \"readers with sensitive feelings\" skip the balance of a chapter. This is more than a recounting of his ordeal, however; Ngor goes a long way toward explaining why a land known for its shy and gentle people became the site of mass killings that reached genocidal proportions. He also provides an excellent account of the origins of the Khmer Rouge and the career of Pol Pot. The latter part of the book has to do with the almost incredible circumstances that led to an Academy Award for his role in the film The Killing Fields.

Manitonquat (Medicine Story), a Wampanoag elder, spiritual leader and storyteller, narrates 11 sparkling tales, many set down in print for the first time. Rich in meaning and flashing with humor, the entries begin with \"Song of Creation,\" in which Kishtannit, the Big Spirit, sings up time, space and movement, followed by the sun, moon and ocean. Subsequent tales measure human experience--the dilemma of death, war, the four seasons, migration--and beneath the dancing language lies a thought-provoking solemnity. Arquette, supplying full-page acrylics interspersed throughout the volume, captures her subjects--both earthly and divine--in an unusual combination of softly smudged contours and bold starkness.

This trick is thrice repeated until at last coyote awakes at home with the bag of salt beside him.

Unable to adjust to life in the South, Frazier went to New York City at age 15 and then to Philadelphia, where eventually a syndicate of businessmen backed him in the ring. He won an Olympic gold medal in 1964 and, after Muhammad Ali was stripped of his title as heavyweight champion for refusing military induction during the Vietnam War, Frazier was named champion in 1970. The following year, he defeated the reinstated Ali and reigned until 1973, when he lost his title to George Foreman. Once a friend of Ali, he became an enemy after a steady barrage of insults from \"The Louisville Lip,\" and it's noteworthy that he always refers to Ali in these pages as Cassius Clay (his pre-Muslim name). Frazier has never ceased to work, nor has he lost faith in the American dream, so his autobiography, written with prize-winning boxing journalist Berger, may prove inspirational to young people.

{"title": "Yellow Ribbon: The Secret Journal of Bruce Laingen", "content": " On Nov. 4, 1979, Iranian revolutionaries took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran, and the 444-day ordeal of 52 American hostages began. Laingen, the embassy's charge d'affaires, was held separately with two staffers until three weeks before the general release. Based on his journal and letters to his family, this book offers a somewhat generalized account of his struggle against anger, frustration and boredom. His captivity was relatively uneventful, and much of the material here concerns his reaction to news, such as the failure of the Desert One rescue mission and Ramsey Clark's visit to Tehran for the \"Crimes of America\" conference. Laingen provides a stirring account of the hours leading up to the release of the hostages, their flight to freedom, their meetings with outgoing President Carter and later with newly inaugurated President Reagan. The predictability of the author's views and the absence of other characters in the journal make it of limited appeal for the general reader. Photos.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

The majority of social workers today are trained to help build the individual's sense of self-esteem, using a psychotherapeutic approach with a primarily middle-class clientele and neglecting the underclass , the social dimension, and the potential for using community capacity to help sustain its members. The authors recommend public policy and fiscal support at federal, state, and county levels to redirect the social work profession toward a community-oriented social care system with the goal of a healthier society for all.

More than 1.5 million women seek medical treatment each year because of assault by a male partner, but the few who kill to escape this torture are judged harshly and sentenced to prison.

Able to generate/intuit new and possibly unpopular ideas and work with determination to make these ideas accepted by others, creative people, the authors state, have the willingness to take sensible risks to go against the crowd in effective ways. These traits may explain why commercial, educational, and political institutions make great overtures to creativity but are seldom truly able to integrate it. Sternberg (editor of Encyclopedia of Human Intelligence, LJ 1/95, among many others) and Lubart also discuss the difference between creative potential and creative performance. They include individual chapters on the six personal, creative resources: intelligence, knowledge, thinking style, personality, motivation, and the environmental context. While not a \"how-to\" book, their work is accessible and appropriate for general psychology collections in larger public libraries and recommended for academic psychology collections.?Scott Johnson, Meridian Community Coll.

{"title": "Are Those Kids Yours?: American Families With Children Adopted From Other Countries", "content": " Drawing from her own experiences and those of others who have adopted children from outside the United States, the author here addresses a range of issues arising from the controversial practice. As the single parent of two Korean-born daughters, Register ( Living with Chronic Illness ) is often faced with the query posed in the book's title. How she and other parents help their foreign-born children ease into American society is examined and evaluated. Larger questions, such as the ethics of uprooting children from their heritage, the global issue of wealthy versus poor countries, the racism often encountered by these children, the wrenching issue of the rights of birth parents, are presented in very personal terms. Internationally adoptive parents will find this an empathetic guide.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "A Question of Character : A Life of John F Kennedy", "content": " This riveting biography by a University of Wisconsin history professor explores John Kennedy's character, assesses its influence on his presidential decisionmaking and brings into focus the discrepancy between the Camelot image and the man himself. Reeves reveals how indifferent Kennedy was to the moral and legal objections to the Bay of Pigs invasion, the overthrow of the Diem regime in South Vietnam, and plans for the assassination of Fidel Castro. There is a wealth of new material here concerning JFK's often precarious health, his relationship with his wife, his flagrant philandering. Reeves concludes that Kennedy abused his high position for personal self-gratification, that his reckless liaisons with women and mobsters were \"irresponsible, dangerous, and demeaning to the office of chief executive.\" By the author of The Life and Times of Joe McCarthy , this is a solidly researched look at John Kennedy's morals or his lack thereof.

Clothes and the Man is a detailed look at selecting, fitting, and wearing men's clothing. Flusser articulately em phasizes natural fabrics, proper fit, and classic styles. Clear illustrations sup plement the text. Considerable atten tion is given to business attire, with the chapter on sportswear the weakest part of the book. The price of the book seems high; recommended, with this reservation. Personal Style covers more territory. Although Wagenvoord discusses cloth ing for men, he also deals with groom ing, hair care, diet and exercise, travel, and entertaining. He spends less time than Flusser on clothing styles, more on caring for garments, and is more supportive of fabric blends as an alter native to natural fibers.

A seven-time World Series of Poker winner, he knows his craft and has now decided to pass a little of his wisdom on to less-skilled players. As the introduction stresses, this is not a book to be perused casually; rather, you read it like a textbook, a training manual for effective poker playing, at both beginning and advanced levels. As in Bellin'sPoker Nation[BKL Mr 15 02], where the author explores the logic behind successful strategy, Hellmuth details card combinations and analyzes situations with the precision of a surgeon. And in both books the art of reading other players receives in-depth analysis. What's unique here is the breadth of coverage, focusing not only on traditional table play but also on online gaming, at which many high-end players now prosper.

His studied simplicity is occasionally touching. But overall the poet's ego is very much in the center of these sentimental verses in a way that impedes their force as love poems.

In that capacity he gained access to a file of 31 letters from Presidents Nixon and Ford to the Vietnamese leader.

Sondheim's creative genius has shaped the contemporary musical, and Zadan interweaves comments by Sondheim's colleagues with a wealth of information about the shows to display the composer's enormous talent. As in the first edition, the focus is on Sondheim's career and accomplishments, and biography is skimpy, except for some isolated, tantalizing facts. But no matter; the detail about the process of putting together a show, plus the profuse illustrations and appendixes containing production information, etc., add up to required reading for all musical theater lovers.

{"title": "Shattered Dreams: The Story of Charlotte Fedders", "content": " As related to Elliott, Fedders's story moves from her birth in Maryland in 1943, through 16 years as an abused wife, to her divorce in 1985 from John R. Fedders, an official of the Securities Exchange Commission. The couple lived graciously in Washington, where in the privacy of their home the husband beat his wife and browbeat their five sons. In a less melodramatic telling, the book would more forcefully call needed attention to the problem of abused women. It is made abundantly clear that Fedders suffered brutality but the reason why she endured it for so many years is not satisfactorily explained. Elliott's contention that the victim's Catholic upbringing trained her to submissiveness is not entirely convincing. And there is no analysis of why the husband, with the same religious background, became a dangerous bully. Elliott is a reporter for Washingtonian magazine.

{"title": "Rules of the Knife Fight", "content": " The third novel by the author of A Dime to Dance By is a powerful and gracefully written, cleverly structured story that displays his remarkable facility with dialogue and character. Although on one level this is a taut murder mystery, it is more an exploration of morality and circumstance, with astonishing surprises in store for the reader. Walker's central theme seems to be that despite everything, the truth will assert itself. The story is told from five points of view: Bobby O'Berry, a punk from Portshead, Mass., who is bullied into marriage by the brothers of his pregnant bride; attorney Chris Cage, who quits his job to defend his wealthy friends Leigh and Cathy Rossville in an unusual civil suit brought by Owen Carr, a hustling private detective who cleverly deduces the truth; and finally Roger Gifford, a judge whose job has left him estranged from his family. \"In litigation,\" Chris explains to Leigh, \"You have what actually happened, . . . what the witnesses say happened, and . . . what the jury decides happened.

{"title": "Secrets of the Soil: A Fascinating Account of Recent Breakthroughs- Scientific and Spiritual- That Can Save Your Garden or Farm", "content": " To those who practice it, biodynamic agriculture is almost a religion, in which Rudolph Steiner serves as high priest, his Agricultural Lectures as bible. Steiner's dubious faith calls for packing manure into cow horns, burying it for a specified period, then digging up the mixture and diluting it to manufacture a spray that apparently eliminates chemical poisons commonly added to the soil. Tompkins and Bird, coauthors of The Secret Life of Plants , cite the work of scientists and philosophers such as Steiner to support their extravagant claims; they report on the special qualities of glacial water and efforts to produce it in the laboratory, and tell of a plant breeder who believes that birdsong, music and a natural foliar fertilizer can stimulate plant growth (\"sonic bloom\"). Such exotic journeys into the fringes of agriculture, best appreciated by true believers, make ordinary organic farming and integrated pest management, though perhaps more effective, seem positively mundane.

He describes Old Hickory's early struggle to overcome his reputation as a violent and vengeful man (\"virtually a social outcast\" in western Tennessee); the spectacular fulfillment of his search for military glory at Horseshoe Bend and New Orleans; and his frequently turbulent two-term administration (1829-1837). In this vivid biography, Remini analyzes his subject's shortcomings, which included wretched administrative appointments, inability to replace the corrupt U.S. Bank with a better system and failure to bring Texas into the Union. But the overall emphasis is on a chief executive who \"served the American people extremely well,\" preserved the integrity of the Union, saved the government from misrule and liquidated the national debt.

{"title": "A First-Class Temperament: The Emergence of Franklin Roosevelt", "content": " This notable biography, following the author's Before the Trumpet: Young Franklin Roosevelt, 1882-1905 , concentrates on character and personality rather than politics or policymaking. Beginning in 1905, with Franklin and Eleanor's honeymoon, it covers FDR's years as New York state senator, assistant secretary of the Navy, his early struggle to overcome the ravages of polio and ends with his election as governor of New York in 1928. Ward not only traces the development of Roosevelt's \"first-class temperament\" but provides dimensional characterizations of friends, enemies and family members, gallantly defending FDR's often-maligned mother, Sara, and revealing the effect on the Roosevelt children of the tensions between Franklin and Eleanor. FDR's jaunty, fun-loving nature and his \"breezy duplicity\" are brought into focus in the early sections, but the tone deepens in the moving account of the future president's valiant but hopeless attempt to regain the use of his legs. Going against the accepted legend, Ward maintains that \"the Roosevelt who could not walk was in most respects very like the one who could.\" Photos.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Leonardo: Discovering the Life of Leonardo Da Vinci", "content": " An \"impeccable dandy,\" charming, brilliant and strikingly handsome da Vinci (1452-1519) emerges in this fresh, gripping portrait as a genius torn by inner conflicts. The polymath artist/engineer/scientist was an illegitimate child traumatized by separation from his loving mother, writes Bramly, biographer of Man Ray. Analyzing Leonardo's notebooks and annotated erotic drawings, as well as contemporary sources, the author depicts the Renaissance prodigy as a man who felt rejected by his father, ambivalent about his homosexuality and both curious about and disgusted by male-female sex. Though vehemently anticlerical, Leonardo believed in God--indeed, was almost jealous of the Creator, whom he called \"inventor of everything.\" Bramly has dusted off the primary sources to make da Vinci a startlingly prescient, relevant figure in this exceptional biography.

Most recipes are low in sugar and fat (with many accompanied by virtually fat-free variations) and tend to feature fruits, nuts and whole grains, but several recipes calling for chocolate may appease a pronounced sweet tooth. The author's directions are abundantly clear, and where she includes techniques for the food processor Alston supplies alternate instructions for hand or blender preparation.

{"title": "Next to Hughes: Behind the Power and Tragic Downfall of Howard Hughes by His Closest Advisor", "content": " Billionaire Howard Hughes's business aide Maheu, writing with freelancer Hack, recounts how during 30 years, starting in 1957, first in Los Angeles and later in Las Vegas, he not only controlled the world's richest man's financial empire (airlines, mines and casinos) but accumulated a large personal fortune while hobnobbing with the rich and powerful--all without ever meeting the reclusive, phobic tycoon. Maheu's career also involved recruiting Mafia connections to carry out the CIA's abortive plot to assassinate Castro and arranging for his boss's donations to such politicians as Nixon, Humphrey and Bobby Kennedy. The self-righteous book pictures Maheu as victim of a scheme by a \"Mormon Mafia\" of aides to turn Hughes against him. Having lost his wealth and spent years battling indictments for fraud and in unsuccessful libel suits against Hughes, Maheu nevertheless \"cried like a child\" upon learning of the boss's mistreatment by his entourage--resulting, alleges Maheu, in Hughes's death.

{"title": "Jefferson Davis: The Man and His Hour", "content": " This portrait puts the emphasis on Davis's private warmth, public coolness, personal insecurity and indecisiveness during the Civil War. Relying mostly on contemporary sources, the author ( Image of the War ) explores how Davis's attitudes and values were developed at West Point and during his Mexican War service and how they were put to the test in his years as U.S. senator, as secretary of war under Franklin Pierce and as president of the Southern Confederacy. The author defends Davis (1808-1889) against the charge that he interfered with his generals, partly by showing how well he and Robert E. Lee worked together. The book also makes clear that Davis lacked managerial skill, was inflexible, could not admit making a mistake and had great difficulty delegating authority. Nevertheless, as the author points out, Davis built the systems that kept the Confederacy afloat from his inauguration in 1862 until he was captured by Union troops in 1865. This is a pragmatic but sympathetic biography that explains why Davis was respected but never loved by the citizens of the Confederate states.

Building on the knowledge passed on by his grandfather, Samuel Ogden (who wrote the original Step by Step in 1975) and on his own years as a market farmer and seedsman, Ogden leads the reader through the process of becoming a good organic gardener. As he states in the epilogue, the book is meant for people who \"want to garden without danger to themselves and without damage to the environment\"; in his view, they're neither fanatics of technique nor devotees of traditional ritual for its own sake. Chapters cover planning, seed starting, compost-making and planting. Along the way to a large section on individual vegetables, Ogden gives his opinions on a variety of subjects, from pesticides and power tools to chemically treated seed and the wisdom behind crop rotation, always taking the reassuring tone of a very patient elder.

Robert Gregory's Diz (Nonfiction Forecasts, Nov. 29), although it does not neglect the colorful side of the athlete and broadcaster, takes a more conventional approach, while the book in hand is anecdotal. Staten ( Unauthorized America ) tries to identify the apocryphal stories, many the result of sportswriters' imaginations, but he relates them nevertheless. The result is a singularly readable account which includes Dizzy's accurate prophetic boast that he and brother Paul would win at least 45 games for the Cardinals in 1934 as well as his response to criticism of his grammar by English teachers: \"Lots of people who ain't sayin' 'ain't' ain't eatin'.\" Never a dull moment.

{"title": "The Language of the Night: Essays on Fantasy and Science Fiction", "content": " For Le Guin, writing science fiction or fantasy is an intuitive, self-exploratory act, an inner-space voyage in which she unearths dreams and archetypes that connect her with the outer world. In these conversational, feisty essays, an energizing mind trip for SF fans, she dissects her own fiction, discusses technique and explores the potential of SF and fantasy, which she considers different branches of the same form of writing. Most SF has been regressive and unimaginative, she argues, by portraying authoritarian dystopias instead of democratic socialist societies.

Cline's stuggle to develop a unique country act began in Winchester, Va., in a musical, if dysfunctional, family. According to Jones, a PW contributing editor, \"a home environment charged with guilt, shame and fear\" led by an abusive father had a direct bearing on the marital problems and hard drinking of Cline's adult years. At the time of her death in a car accident at age 30, Cline was a headliner at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, a multimillion-dollar recording star and an influence on a generation of country singers with classics like \"Crazy\" and \"Walking After Midnight.\" This sad story follows the grueling hardships and remarkable triumphs of a legendary country musician.

Baby boomers come under particular attack for \"their relentless pursuit of social anarchy.\" Thomas shows no patience for those who, in his opinion, use their freedom of expression improperly, among them the ACLU and network television. Thomas's prose is blunt, his arguments visceral rather than reasoned.

Nevertheless, she helped to form a remarkable cartel of news organizations to jointly publish non-bylined (and thus safer) investigative reports on the drug organizations, and also uncovered for her paper massacres by militias associated with the government. Less a personal tale than a survey of Colombia's recent past, the book is disorganized at times, offering detailed accounts of Colombian politics.

In the former Soviet Union, information about crime was rarely forthcoming, but now this shocking case has received considerable publicity and spawned several new and forthcoming books (Peter Conradi's The Red Ripper , Dell, 1992; Robert Cullen's The Killer Department , previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 1/93). Lourie, author of Russia Speaks ( LJ 3/15/91), focuses on detective Issa Kostoev, who led the years-long investigation that finally caught Chikatilo (but not before an innocent man was executed for his first murder).

Tarkanian's reputation for giving academically borderline players a second chance (and then winning championships with them) is one reason for his decade long struggle with the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the governing agency for collegiate sports. The NCAA has a history of selective enforcement of their rules and has actively pursued Tarkanian, who is one of their most outspoken critics. While Yaeger is overly supportive of Tarkanian, he makes a strong case for the NCAA having too much unrestrained authority.

{"title": "Magical Passes: The Practical Wisdom of the Shamans of Ancient Mexico", "content": " Cult author Castaneda has written nine books (e.g., The Teachings of Don Juan, LJ 3/1/69) chronicling the life and practices of Yaqui sorcerer Don Juan Matus. While these books talk about the magical and shamanistic practices of Don Juan and his lineages, this new book begins with Don Juan chiding Castaneda about his physical well-being (or lack of it) and then teaching Castaneda the physical movements practiced by the sorcerers. These magical movements are called \"tensegrity\"?a combination of the tension of contracting and relaxing with the integrity of the body moving in one complete unit. The bulk of the book is a detailed step-by-step description and photographs of the movements, which can be done following the book but require a concentration that cuts out extraneous thought.

Davis (Jefferson Davis: The Man and His Hour) chronicles the development of the Old Southwest (Mississippi and Alabama) from early settlement through the 1830s. Settlers came overland from Nashville, Tenn., to Natchez, Miss. (the \"Trace\"), or by boat on the great river. This is lively history, replete with colorful characters?Col. James Wilkinson, Aaron Burr, Sir William Dunbar and a man who tried his hand at everything, Gideon Lincecum. The author paints a vivid picture of Natchez as sin city with its drinking, whoring and gambling. He charts the rise of King Cotton and conflicts between merchants and planters. He describes Indian-white relations, the struggles to set up schools and churches and state politics. Davis leaves no doubt the Southern Frontier was just as wild as the Wild West. Illustrations.

Given the huge gaps in theoretical astronomy that remain, theirs was not an unreasonable approach . In her much longer exegesis, science writer Bartusiak ( Thursday's Universe ) finds no odds-on winner, either. She offers a lively review of astronomers' struggle to find the stuff of the universe since Hubble. Sidelights on the quirks in the personal lives of 19th-century astronomers (the author is more discreet in her profiles of the living) interrupt the time line of the science. With the number of portraits and interviews here, the book would have been as appropriately subtitled Lives of the Astronomers. Illustrated.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Message from Forever: A Novel of Aboriginal Wisdom", "content": " A warmed-over account of an Australian woman's walkabout in search of her aboriginal heritage and the meaning of existence, this latest offering from the author of the bestselling Mutant Message Down Under is more of the same: rage over the aborigines' disenfranchisement, touchy-feely eulogies for their nomadic wisdom and dire predictions of an ecological doomsday for the civilization that did them in. When Beatrice Lake is separated the day after her birth from her teenage aborigine mother and twin brother, she begins a lifelong journey that will take her back to her ancestry and ultimately reunite her with her twin, Geoff, who is serving a life sentence in a Florida prison. After 36 years in the wilderness, Bea decides to return to civilization and repatriate Geoff. Overflowing with intimations of \"Oneness,\" \"Foreverness,\" \"Knowingness\" and such icons as the Rainbow Snake from the mythic Dreamtime, this humdrum little walk on the wild side is unworthy of Morgan's real-life concerns with the plight of the aborigines and the environment.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

This autobiographical account, coauthored with noted racing journalist Bourcier, is interspersed with 75 black-and-white photographs and relevant quotes from people close to Stewart his mom, his girlfriend, members of his racing team, other famous drivers, and so forth. Having originally flourished in the South, NASCAR has become increasingly popular throughout the United States over the last decade. Still, 400 pages is a lot of text about a 30-year-old athlete, no matter how accomplished.

The 73 recipes are good, honest fare from the 1930s and '40s for everyday and special occasions. At least as interesting as the recipes is the glimpse into Wilder's happy and productive adult life as a farmer, friend, and writer. This large format book is full of black-and-white photographs of her family and friends, and full-color photos of Rocky Ridge Farm, inside and out. The farm pictures tend to be posed and repetitious; but for Wilder fans this volume will illuminate a facet of her life that is new for some readers.

This time, Hippo can't decide what to wish for, but having consulted all his friends, who suggest that he wish to look like them, he decides to wish to stay just as he is. He also engages in a lemonade price-war with his friend Snake, listens to a scary campfire story starring a slimy purple one-eyed monster and does a spot of cloud-picture gazing. There's more zip to these new Hippo stories, more genuine, if subtle, humor. Hippo's dilemmas aren't earthshaking, but his gently bumbling character is endearing, and some of his friends have real personality. The tone is a far cry from Thaler's slam-bang joke collections, and Hippo 's two-color ink and wash drawings, with their softly pudgy animals, are a world away from the author's own wild cartoons, but these creatures are perfectly in tune with Hippo 's low-key stories and add funny detail.

Beautiful, soft landscapes of the rugged terrain throughout the seasons serve as a backdrop for this charming story of a librarian on the go. While Miss Dorothy's dreams of a stately brick building as a true library seems to undermine the worth of the bookmobile a bit, the overall effect is that of nostalgia and a sweet homage to a special woman.

In this collection of essays the author of The Discovers and the trilogy The Americans writes with the breadth and vitality that mark all his books. His title has deliberate meaning: Boorstin implies the historian's need to probe socio-political patterns from philosophical and uncliched angles. Here he recaptures his \"historical adventures,\" ranging from a study of the historian's discipline (his insight into Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire as an \"intimate\" work is rich and subtle) through a look at America as a \"By-Product Nation\" not greatly driven by theories, but rather formed by action under stress (he sees FDR's four-term presidency as an example). And finally, a series of segments from his writingspresent his views of America's \"unsung\" political experiments. Boorstin's closing emphasis on our unacknowledged dominance by the \"kingdom of the Machine\" leads readers to hope for his further expansion of this theme.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Divorced from Justice: The Abuse of Women and Children by Divorce Lawyers and Judges", "content": " In 1992, Winner, a consultant on women's rights in the courts, wrote the report \"Women in Divorce\" for New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs, and this study is an elaboration of that account. The gist of it is that when a divorce is not amicable, the woman is usually treated unfairly by the courts. Ironically, some of the legislation passed since 1970 to aid women in divorce cases, such as equitable distribution, community property and mediation laws, has had the opposite effect, because it allows lawyers to rack up hours chasing down assets. Winner considers lawyers a major factor in the many injustices divorcing women suffer, largely because many lawyers, in her view, are interested not in fairness but money. Winner offers several valuable solutions \"to shift the balance from a lawyer-centered system to a consumer-driven system.\" This book will be important reading for women contemplating divorce. $50,000 ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Paradise of the Blind: A Novel", "content": " This staunchly unsentimental, evocative novel, originally published in Huong's native Vietnam and beautifully translated by Duong and McPherson, offers a narrative rich in detail and free of cliche. The author, who lives with her children in Hanoi, depicts the complexity of Vietnamese culture--the allegiance to family and ancestors, the symbolic value of food, class distinctions and the continuing sense of desperation mingled with pride. The protagonist, Hang, a physically fragile young woman of the '80s, recalls Hanoi in the previous decade. While there are subtle allusions to war and peacetime, Huong's focus is on the shifting, uneasy relationships between modernized Hang and her traditionalist mother, a merchant who peddles food; Hang's selfish, hypocritical uncle, a communist peasant; and Hang's comparatively wealthy, unconditionally loving aunt. Contrasts between young, old, urban and rural, help to convey the full variety of Vietnamese lifestyles. McPherson's introduction provides essential background information without spoiling the plot of Huong's unquestionably powerful tale.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

When they disappear along with the courier, her half-brother, Lee, she is the only one who believes that he didn't steal them. Kate tries to get the FBI and other authorities involved, but they assume that Lee stole the gems and is living the high life abroad, so she investigates on her own, starting at a gem show near her Arizona home. There she awakens the instincts of rogue FBI agent Sam Groves, who is part of a task force trying to stop the rise in gem thefts. He spots Kate palming an exceptional sapphire and intercepts her, but it's a beautiful fake and she ditches him. He tracks her down; Kate decides to trust him, and he, in turn, trusts her, jeopardizing his career to follow his hunch about the thieves in spite of his superiors' objections.

The \"eighty/twenty rule\" is paramount: \"Eighty percent of our results are produced by about twenty percent of what we do.\" Unfortunately, the book embodies this rule a little too well: about twenty percent is truly solid advice, while eighty percent feels more like filler (\"The man took out his notebook to record what he sensed was going to be useful information\") padded further with extra-large type.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

He was accepted as a clown and spent the eight-month 1993 season with the Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros. Circus, which plays the South and Northeast. With performers from more than a dozen countries, this troupe was truly a melting pot, though most had picked up some of the racism they encountered here. Far from conforming to the image of degenerates, the circus people the author met led rather conventional lives within their restricted world. Feiler admits the humor of clowns is \"silly,\" and few readers are likely to share his admiration for acts like that of a young woman who juggles while hanging by her hair.

Immediately after he arrives at the elegant estate, he overhears a heated argument between the snobbish caretaker and her sarcastic assistant manager.

{"title": "Warning: Psychiatry Can Be Hazardous to Your Mental Health", "content": " Swimming against what he sees as the tide of prescriptions written for antidepressants such as Paxil, Zoloft and Prozac, psychiatrist Glasser (Choice Theory) argues that these drugs can do more harm than good. He asserts that there has been some scientifically sound psychiatric research that suggests the drugs can damage mental health and even the brain itself. Through selective case studies and extrapolation of evidence, the author urges readers to think twice before accepting \"brain drugs\"; he states that the effectiveness of certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has been exaggerated by the drug companies. To his credit, Glasser does offer several practical alternatives for patients. But he seems to cherish his outsider status and questions the way psychiatry is practiced today. Group therapy transcripts and case studies constitute the bulk of his case, and chapters like \"Luck, Intimacy, and Our Quality World\" and \"We Have Learned to Destroy Our Own Happiness\" are designed to help the reader understand symptoms. Some of the anecdotes are compelling, and individuals seeking alternatives to drug treatments may benefit.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

{"title": "Moral Combat: Good and Evil in World War II", "content": " Starred Review. A moral history of WWII would be brief, said one wit, but respected British historian Burleigh (Blood Rage: A Cultural History of Terrorism) delivers a long, riveting account of awful events and the perverted reasoning behind them. Communist, Nazi, Fascist, and Japanese systems claimed to be regimes of public virtue carrying out inexorable historical processes. Proclaiming that the only evil was obstructing this march to utopia, all discarded the rule of law and alternative moral authority (religion, ethics). The Holocaust and other familiar WWII atrocities top off an exhaustive litany of mass murder, brutality, and squalid cruelty perpetrated by governments, military leaders, local officials, and ordinary individuals who, acting without moral values, became monsters. Burleigh does not ignore Hiroshima and Allied mass bombing campaigns, but deplores the current fashion for balancing the moral books. All nations acted shamefully, he concludes, but denies that Eleanor Roosevelt's youthful anti-Semitism made America complicit with Hitler, as one recent revisionist implied. 16 pages of color photos.

{"title": "Katharine Hepburn Once Said...: Great Lines to Live By", "content": " Readers who are unwilling to truck through A. Scott Berg's lengthy biography Kate Remembered may want to pick up Crimp's little volume of the great actress's best quips. The author of Touched by a Saint: Personal Encounters with Mother Teresa and The Many Lives of Elton John collects \"Hepburnisms\" on subjects ranging from love and marriage to aging gracefully, packaging them into an attractive bundle of text (printed in large font) and photographs. Upbeat and straightforward, Hepburn has spunky thoughts on women (\"I find a woman's point of view much grander and finer than a man's\"); life (\"If you obey all the rules, you miss all the fun!\"); and her career (\"I don't care how afraid I may be inside-I do what I think I should\"). Crimp refrains from making comments about Hepburn's thoughts, leaving readers to interpret them as they will. Although many of the quotations are missing year and source attributions, this collection provides a cheering, lighthearted survey of Hepburn's work and life. 39 b&w; photos.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Radiant", "content": " With this Buddhist-tinged military SF novel featuring Admiral Festina Ramos and the Expendables (skilled, dispensable scouts), Aurora Award&ndash;winning Canadian author Gardner (Expendable, etc.) makes a well-earned leap from paperback to hardcover. Explorer Third Class Youn Suu, a scout for the elite Explorer Corps, and her partner Tut set out to rescue the Cashlings from the Balrog, an alien intelligence capable of knowing its enemy's best-laid plans. Accompanied by Admiral Ramos, Youn and Tut travel to an eerie planet that holds the answer to the mystery of the hidden origins of the Explorers. Filled with believably flawed, emotionally involving characters, this entertaining novel of brawn and brains thoughtfully explores questions of honor, culpability and the price of survival.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "We Belong to the Land: The Story of A Palestinian Israeli Who Lives for Peace and Reconciliation", "content": " The conflict of being a clergyman and a Palestinian Arab in Israel forms the backdrop for this human drama as the author, a priest in the Melkite Catholic Church, tries to serve as a spokesperson for fellow Palestinians against what they perceive as injustices imposed on them by a Jewish state. Among the travails he relates are the destruction of his village in the Upper Galilee by Israeli authorities, who transformed the area into a military security zone; and the forced evacuation of Biram, another village in the Galilee. Similar and complementary to Beyond Occupation , edited by Rosemary Radford Reuther and Marc Ellis ( LJ 7/90), this is recommended for those interested in a local perspective on the communal conflict in contemporary Israel.- Sanford R.

{"title": "Desert Wisdom: Sacred Middle Eastern Writings from the Goddess Through the Sufis", "content": " This book tries to invent an overarching Middle Eastern spirituality using 3000 years of religious history and a dozen widely disparate cultures-something that cannot be done. There is no more a single coherent spirituality of the Middle East than of the West (which Douglas-Klotz deplores) or of Native Americans (which he applauds). Indeed, beliefs as divergent as those of the Egyptian Middle Kingdom and the Mandeans can only be compared. The author frequently uses \"expanded translation,\" a lengthy commentary in verse, to explicate much shorter selections of ancient poetry. But often these expansions err, e.g., ancient spirituality cannot be understood in terms of modern physics (\"wave and particle\") or New Age thought (\"vibration\"). If Desert Wisdom has little to commend it in theoretical terms, it has less as a work of popular spirituality, offering meditations consisting mainly of mantras, centering methods, guided imaginings, and breathing exercises-useful practices but already more thoroughly treated elsewhere.

{"title": "A Noble Death: Suicide and Martyrdom Among Christians and Jews in Antiquity", "content": " Focusing primarily on the period from the death of Socrates to Augustine of Hippo, the authors investigate the Greek legacy: the six cases of voluntary death in the Hebrew Bible and later references to these; Josephus, Philo, and early Rabbinic ideas; early Christian ideas of martyrdom and the teachings of Greek Fathers of the Church and Tertullian. They emphasize the voluntariness of martyrdom and the great shift in Christian opinion of voluntary death occasioned by Augustine's absolute condemnation of it, except in the express instance of divine command. Droge and Tabor view their study as important background to today's death-with-dignity issues. This relevance makes the book important for the informed layperson as well as scholars, ethicists, and clergy. Highly recommended for academic and large public libraries.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "The Physics of Angels: Exploring the Realm Where Science and Spirit Meet", "content": " Here is another book about heaven's winged creatures. But, what a book this is. Essentially a dialogue between the radical theologian and Episcopalian priest Fox and maverick biologist Sheldrake, this book is a bizarre amalgam of New Age speculation and exploration of the writings of Dionysius the Areopagite, Thomas Aquinas and Hildegard of Bingen for news of angels. Of angel lore there is much of merit in this book, but the book is irritating when it pretends to be science rather than spirituality. The authors' work would have benefited from a heavier editorial hand, for the book often reads like an e-mail exchange in which the effort at dialogue too easily descends into monologue. Fox and Sheldrake have written a book that is charming without being dangerous.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "The Reinvention of Work: New Vision of Livelihood for Our Time, A", "content": " \"To live well is to work well,\" wrote Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century, yet many people are reporting to jobs every day that provide little satisfaction. Fox, a former Catholic priest and widely published author (Creation Spirituality, LJ 5/1/91), asserts that life and livelihood are about spirit. He contrasts the machine era, when the universe was perceived as a machine, with the green (\"sheen\") era, when the universe is seen as a mystery and where God is in all things. Arguing that all work should have dignity, Fox envisions a work world in which intellect, heart, and health harmonize to celebrate the whole person. Though Fox achieves his aims of providing an essay in \"deep ecumenism,\" his philosophy of work seems to have little practical relevance to the work world.

{"title": "The Religious History of America: The Heart of the American Story from Colonial Times to Today", "content": " Since the first edition was published in 1966, this work has remained a standard text for American religious history. The 2002 revision, by Gaustad (history, emeritus, Univ. of California, Riverside) and Schmidt (religion, Princeton Univ.), retains the core material with a revised chapter structure, updated bibliographies, and some text revisions. In some cases, the revisions are simply rearrangements of chapter sections, while in others there is a shift in terminology e.g., using \"African American\" for \"black\" and replacing \"American religion\" with the more clearly designated \"American Protestantism.\" While such changes are subtle, they do alter the tone of the work, bringing it more in line with current approaches to the study of religion and American culture. In the case of the last three chapters, the authors have done considerable revision and brought the history up to the turn of the century. The overall result is a well-balanced enhancement of an excellent work. Recommended for all libraries. Jan Blodgett, Davidson Coll.

Based on journal entries made at the time, this account of their emergence from counterculture adolescence and drug-induced euphoria follows the wandering couple on a route that leads to home and total commitment to Christianity.

{"title": "The Dance of the Dissident Daughter: A Woman's Journey from Christian Tradition to the Sacred Feminine", "content": " The author's journey to capture her feminine soul and to live authentically from that soul makes a fascinating, well-researched and well-written story. Kidd's successful pilgrimage from her Southern Baptist roots and away from the patriarchal and fundamentalist Christian religious systems surrounding her is an account of anger turned to courage, creativity and love. A mid-career realization that she had lived without \"real inner authority\" and with \"a fear of dissension, confrontation, backlash, a fear of not pleasing, not living up to sanctioned models of femininity\" produced in Kidd the new mindset that made her journey possible. Additionally, her extensive knowledge of many subjects, including theology, mythology and the arts, made possible the copious references and cross-references that will prove invaluable for readers who wish to follow her in this same search. While Kidd cautions that each woman's path will be unique, there is no question but that many women will find in her book a mirror of their own present conditions and a hopeful call to self-discovery.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Dancing In The Water Of Life        Volume 5:1963-1965: Seeking Peace in the Hermitage (Merton, Thomas//Journal of Thomas Merton)", "content": " This is the fourth of seven planned volumes of Merton's private journal. Merton, who died in 1968, was a Trappist monk, peace activist and well-loved author of spiritual classics such as The Seven Storey Mountain. Neither mundane nor egotistical, these journal entries demonstrate Merton's characteristic humor and warmth. This journal reflects a time in Merton's life when he is trying to balance his popularity as an author and speaker with his vows of silence as a Trappist monk, his pacifism and his political beliefs with his submission to the authority of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Above all, Merton's intellectual curiosity about a number of matters?including international and Vatican politics, architecture and his personal relationships?marks this fascinating journal.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"title": "Facing East: A Pilgrim's Journey into the Mysteries of Orthodoxy", "content": " The homespun mingles with the majestic in this affectionate account of a family's romance with an ancient form of Christianity. The author, a columnist for the Religion News Service, was a lapsed Roman Catholic who tried Hinduism before becoming a charismatic Episcopalian; her husband, Fr. Gregory, pastor of the Holy Cross Mission in Baltimore, is a former Episcopal priest. Homeschoolers who believed the Episcopal Church was \"repealing the creed and condoning immorality,\" the couple has joined a contingent of evangelical Christians who have, in recent years, been converting to Eastern Orthodoxy. Mathewes-Green offers an intimate glimpse of this piece of the contemporary American religious landscape. Writing with charm and humor and a convert's zeal, she weaves reflections on family life, friendship and personal spirituality with descriptions of Orthodox worship and fellowship. However, she glosses over Orthodoxy's theology and ecclesiastical structure, focusing mainly on externals. As a result, lifelong Orthodox may feel this chatty depiction trivializes their faith, while outsiders may be frustrated by the lack of explanatory content.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "A Search for Solitude: Pursuing the Monk's True LifeThe Journals of Thomas Merton, Volume 3: 1952-1960", "content": " A Cistercian monk and author of the bestselling The Seven Storey Mountain, Merton records in his plain journal voice the struggles of a soul wrestling with both his vocation and his location, the Abbey of Our Lady of Gesthsemani near Bardstown,Ky. The journal pages are filled with spiritual ruminations, catalogues of Merton's correspondences and his reaction to them, lists of encounters with his fellows constrained by the discipline of the Abbey, his hopes for relocation to a mountaintop hermitage and all the day-to-day froth thst sits atop the deep currents of Merton's spiritual life. Part commonplace book, part spiritual journal, part diarist's discipline, the journal is both the sediment of his spiritual development and the tool he used to watch himself watching himself.

{"title": "The Awakened Heart: Living Beyond Addiction", "content": " Efficiency versus love; attachment to performing, or achieving, against the freedom of simply being; the \"how\" of life opposed to the \"why\"--within these polarities occur the addictions that noted psychiatrist May ( Addiction and Grace ) defines as dysfunctions hobbling human spiritual potential. Integrating the wisdom of ancient mystics and the insights of contemporary thinkers, May examines the spiritual longings that are often hidden and controlled by society's pressures and expectations. Counseling against expecting perfection in human relationships, he reminds that \"we are not meant to have all our yearnings satisfied and our spaces filled as individuals.\" In the tradition of M.

{"title": "Our Greatest Gift: A Meditation on Dying and Caring", "content": " Nouwen, well-loved author of such books as The Wounded Healer , offers us here a gentle, almost meditative book on coming to terms with death. Reflecting on his own not-so-distant future death, as well as on the deaths of loved ones and friends, he shares his view of death as a gift, an opportunity to impart hope to those around us, whether through our own dying or in our caretaking of someone else. In embracing death, says Nouwen, one comes to ask: \"How can I so live that I can continue to be fruitful when I am no longer here among my family and friends?\" One can, in other words, make choices that effect not just one's self but also the generations to come--choices to care well, to die well and to embrace Grace. If there is a limitation to this book it lies in its failure to deal explicitly as well as implicitly with sudden and/or violent death. This is a very comforting book that will appeal to the general reader as well as the religious or to health professionals.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Spong is careful to acknowledge previous scholars and to distinguish fact or knowledge from speculation. He encourages a midrashish or imaginative approach to the Gospels and points out how literalism of scripture and creed in the Virgin Mary references led to sexism in church teaching.

He's not a madman, just absolutely sure that he knows more than judge, jury and the legal system when it comes to administering justice. After a fellow crime lab employee approaches him about discrepancies in his work, he adds murder to his list of methods that ensure his continuing crusade. Amanda is still working in her father's law firm and still having trouble with her love life, though Margolin wisely steers clear of wasting much time on her personal problems.

{"title": "Control Your Destiny or Someone Else Will (Collins Business Essentials)", "content": " Jack Welch is undoubtedly one of the most talked about chief executives in America. Three months apart, two books have appeared about Welch and his mandate to restructure GE in the 1980s. Unlike Robert Slater's The New GE: How Jack Welch Revived an American Institution ( LJ 10/1/92), authors Tichy, a professor and GE consultant, and Sherman, a Fortune reporter, offer a deeper analysis of Welch's leadership practices and philosophies. The authors use the first person singular to signify an insider's (Tichy's) view, which is confusing at first. Furthermore, the addition of the \"Handbook for Revolutionaries\" (material developed at GE's executive education center in Crotonville, New York) makes Tichy appear to be a Welch convert, and the bias is sometimes too obvious. The repetition of ideas makes reading laborious. However, the authors do a substantial job in presenting the research, which included over 100 hours of interviews with Welch.

Faith is invited to the island by reclusive bestselling author, Barbara Bailey Bishop, presumably to cater the gathering, but Faith soon suspects that she and the other guests, the hostess's former classmates from Seven Sisters&ndash;style Pelham College, have all been invited under false pretenses. Flashbacks to the class of '70s school days reveal that Barbara's twin sister, Helene \"Prin\" Prince, fell from a campus tower the night before graduation&mdash;an apparent suicide. After a northeaster cuts off all access to the mainland, one of the guests is found dead. As the death toll mounts, Faith seeks answers and wonders if she will be the next victim.

{"title": "A False Mirror (Inspector Ian Rutledge Mysteries)", "content": " Starred Review.The complex, evocative ninth installment in Todd's series set in post-WWI England (after 2006'sLong Shadow) showcases the pseudonymous author's usual subtle understatement and deft characterization. Scotland Yard Inspector Ian Rutledge, who has returned from the trench warfare of France haunted by the carnage (and in particular by his order to execute one of his own men), heads to the seaside village of Hampton Regis to defuse a hostage situation. Stephen Mallory, who served under Rutledge's command in the war and is suspected of viciously assaulting his ex-lover's husband, demands Rutledge's presence before he will release his ex-lover and other hostages. To manage the crisis, Rutledge must weather the suspicions of the local police and identify the person responsible for the assault and two subsequent murders. Todd, a mother-and-son writing team, seamlessly melds a fair-play whodunit with psychological suspense in the tradition of P.D.

{"title": "Symmetry: A Journey into the Patterns of Nature", "content": " When most of us think of symmetry, we think of looking into a mirror or playing patty-cake with a child. As Oxford don du Sautoy (The Music of the Primes) tells readers, this is only the tip of the triangle in the mathematical realms of symmetry, where symmetrical objects exist in dimensions far beyond our ability to imagine. The author takes readers gently by the hand and leads them elegantly through some steep and rocky terrain as he explains the various kinds of symmetry and the objects they swirl around. Du Sautoy explains how this twirling world of geometric figures has strange but marvelous connections to number theory, and how the ultimate symmetrical object, nicknamed the Monster, is related to string theory. This book is also a memoir in which du Sautoy describes a mathematician's life and how one makes a discovery in these strange lands. He also blends in minibiographies of famous figures like Galois, who played significant roles in this field. This is mainly for science buffs, but fans of scientific biographies will also find it appealing. B&amp;w illus.(Mar.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Growth for its own sake, particularly when it involves diversification into products unrelated to a company's original business, Ries says, causes many companies to become unfocused, confuses customers and loses money. The frenzy for acquisitions that spread many a well-known brand name over a diversity of products has proved untenable, with the result that companies that grew fat are regaining their original focus by slimming down. Sears, Roebuck, a once focused retailer that expanded unwisely into real estate, stock brokering, business system centers and credit cards, is having to divest itself of all but its original retail chain. Managers seeking to focus or refocus their companies will find helpful examples here, drawn from a broad range of enterprises. $50,000 ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

A friend's request to locate her missing husband puts Loy on a trail that leads to a corpse found within the foundations of the city's town hall, a notorious family of brothers who head an organized crime ring, heroin funding, numerous murders, possible IRA involvement and much more. When the pace momentarily slackens, the author supplies some nicely observed pastoral views of Dublin and the Irish countryside, but the ongoing cacophony of violence deafens one to all but the most sanguinary details. Hughes has talent, but this caper, his first, doesn't whet one's appetite for more of the same.(Mar.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Alison efficiently handles the first two problems, hiring attorneys specializing in discrimination and divorce. With her supportive college student son, Chris, she heads for Sedona, Ariz., her hometown, to visit her sympathetic parents and await news of Reenie. When Chris sets up a blog for her, Alison, usually tense and judgmental, begins revealing herself to strangers, a practice that leads to a personal threat. After Reenie's body is found, the police pronounce her a suicide; Alison disagrees and begins to investigate her friend's life. The reader learns much about age and sex discrimination, spousal abuse, the effects of catastrophic illness on families and anonymous Internet communication.

That would include the guy in the car  next to you blasting his music as well as the person price-gouging hurricane  victims. The murders are accomplished in appropriately bizarre, if not graphic,  fashion.

Based on more than 400 interviews, over a four-year span, with young men ages 16&ndash;26, Kimmel's study shows that the guys who live in Guyland are mostly white, middle-class, totally confused and cannot commit to their relationships, work or lives. Although they seem baffled by the riddles of manhood and responsibility, they submit to the Guy Code, where locker-room behaviors, sexual conquests, bullying, violence and assuming a cocky jock pose can rule over the sacrifice and conformity of marriage and family. Obsessed with never wanting to grow up, this demographic, which is 22 million strong, craves video games, sports and depersonalized sexual relationships.

When an attractive male colleague, Angus Holt, convinces Nat to accompany him on a teaching assignment at a nearby prison, a sudden riot puts them both in peril. Nat finds herself desperately attempting to save the life of a guard, apparently stabbed by an inmate during the fracas. The dying man asks her to pass on his last words to his wife, but possessing knowledge of this cryptic message proves dangerous. Nat finds herself accused of murder and must evade the law while also tracking down the bad guys.

{"title": "Instead of Three Wishes: Magical Short Stories", "content": " Princes in disguise, royal elves and book-loving ghosts all play a part in the seven stories of this intermittently promising collection. Throughout, debut author Turner's style is expansive, allowing for mood-setting details and for occasionally sharp wit, but most of her plots follow familiar, predictable patterns. As a rural town fills up with leprechaun-hunters in \"A Plague of Leprechaun,\" for example, it's easily foreseen that the sole disinterested party, an art school graduate intent on pursuing his craft, will end up with the little green fellow's bag of gold. On the other hand, the entry \"Aunt Charlotte and the NGA Portraits\" is a standout. This carefully framed narrative unfolds slowly and suspensefully to reveal a series of puzzles, their settings ranging from an underpopulated island off North Carolina to Canaletto's Venice, their marvelous resolution followed by a denouement of near-equal magic. The inventiveness and control shown here augur well for Turner's future endeavors.

{"title": "Friends of the Family: The Inside Story of the Mafia Cops Case", "content": " The 2005 case of \"mafia cops\" Louis Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa rocked New York and the brotherhood that protects it. Two crooked NYPD officers who, throughout their careers, worked as hitmen for the Lucchese crime family, the duo came to justice only after 20 years of effort from law enforcement officers determined to put together all the pieces. Dades, a detective on the case, and Vecchione, a prosecutor, tell the story of the professionals who actually broke the case in a thorough step-by-step procedural. Author Fisher keeps the narrative moving with a good balance of police work, politics and mafia drama, channeling with authority (and the coaching of Dades and Vecchione) the voices of the street as well as the police force. Those expecting a Sopranos-style mob narrative will find this heavy on the police work, but true crime fans should be happy to get past the hype and into the nitty-gritty of this infamous case.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Blown Away (Frank Corso)", "content": " In the gritty sixth Frank Corso novel (after 2005's No Man's Land), Ford makes clever use of an actual 2003 unsolved case to create a pulse-pounding plot capped by a dramatic and chilling ending. Corso, an investigative journalist whose promising career was derailed by a scandal, is sent by his publisher to a small Pennsylvania town to solve an unusual cold case. In an attempted bank robbery, a seemingly innocuous local, who presented his demands for cash with a bomb strapped around his neck, died when the device exploded. Corso is uninterested in the assignment until his initial inquiries lead to attempts on his life. The case takes on a whole new dimension when similar crimes begin to occur on the West Coast, leading the federal authorities to take a keen interest in the reporter's discoveries. While the eventual revelation of the motive behind the crimes is a little disappointing, this doesn't detract from the overall impact of this well-written and paced thriller.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "DSI--Date Scene Investigation: The Diagnostic Manual of Dating Disorders", "content": " Helping women recognize men who are not relationship material is Kerner's focus, and the subject matter is narrated with mind-numbing gravitas by the sex-expert author. However, what's useful is that hearing the men described one after the other allows the listener to see the entire male landscape more objectively. But, entertaining as it is, the material is almost entirely anecdotal and falls short of providing any organizing insights women can use when dealing with men's personality and emotional issues. The second complaint is the cutesy framing of this lesson as an investigative crime show with its overly serious narration and silly terms like \"dating diagnostic\" and \"missing boyfriend unit.\" The artifice makes the program sound dumbed-down.

Her father, whom she rarely saw, was a manager at the Bank of Egypt; her mother was taken up in the expatriate social whirl. Lively's upbringing was left to Lucy, a young English woman, who was first her nurse and then her governess.

{"title": "Thanksgiving: An AIDS Journal", "content": " The tragedy of a New York couple recounted in this candid, poignant journal also serves as a means of catharsis for the first-time author, who is the widow of an AIDS-afflicted mate. Cox's pain over her impending loss was compounded by a sense of betrayal at the duplicity of Keith, who had not told her he was gay until he sickened. During months of nursing him she grappled with a need to reassess their relationship and protect their two-year-old son Luke from the stigma of his father's illness. Anger and fear vied with love while a growing exhaustion bred the author's resentment and despair. Keith died in 1987 after an intentional overdose of medication. His last words to his wife were, \"You are my victory. Luke will be my triumph.\"Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

{"title": "Patton: Genius for War, A", "content": " Perhaps the most renowned and controversial American general of the 20th century, George Patton (1885-1945) remains a subject of intense interest. D'Este (Decision in Normandy) provides new information from family archives and other sources about Patton's ancestry, childhood and pre-WWII military career. This includes his student years at West Point, his experience as a tank officer in WWI and various interwar staff assignments. The author emphasizes Patton's lifelong study and preparation for war and his conviction that God not only chose him specifically to lead an army but also stood ready to intervene to assure him battlefield victories. D'Este has much to say about Patton's impulsiveness, impatience and tactlessness, showing how these qualities often got him in trouble with the public as well as with his superiors. The account of Patton's campaigns from North Africa through Sicily, Normandy and the Ardennes enables the reader to understand why the general is regarded as one of the great military leaders. This is a major biography of a major American military figure.

Age 26 at the time and feeling lost and desperate after indulging in the excesses of the 1960s, the Jewish author had no real hope for inspiration from the course because of its Christian terminology. But, she writes in this guide to the guide, the program works \"miracles\" for herself and for others who adopt its principles. Her extrapolations may appeal to readers in need of spiritual sustenance, but one questions Williamson's advice to the gravely ill. When she encourages them, for example, to \"write a letter to AIDS or cancer or whatever illness they might have, and tell it everything they feel\"--even to fabricate \"replies\" from the disease--readers are likely to consider that a serious situation is trivialized.

Lerner (The Dance of Deception) offers advice to women on love, friendship, marriage, parenting and sexual politics. Her warm, conversational style is engaging and meshes well with her commonsense approach to problem solving. Lerner advises women that many emotional problems between people spring from a lack of communication, and that differences must be faced before they can be solved. A self-described feminist, Lerner is pro-choice and believes that same-sex love is as \"normal\" as heterosexuality. Despite the format, which dictates short answers to broad questions, the author provides thoughtful comments geared to helping women surmount their difficulties.

His well-translated work, originally published in Mexico as three separate volumes, offers a readable history of the country since independence in 1810. Krauze first identifies themes that permeate Mexican history, e.g., the concentration of power, the role of the church, and the importance of history to Mexicans, which he then elaborates on by relaying the history of Mexico through the biography of its leaders, primarily presidents. As a result, he offers rewarding insight into how Mexicans see their own history.

{"title": "Mornings Like This: Found Poems", "content": " Found poems are to their poet what no-fault insurance is to beneficiaries: payoffs waiting to happen where everyone wins and no one is blamed. Dillard culls about 40 such happy accidents from sources as diverse as a The American Boys Handy Book (1882) and the letters of Van Gogh. Taking the texts nearly verbatim but toying with theme and line breaks, the poet aims for a lucky, loaded symbolism that catapults the reader into an epiphany never imagined by the original authors. If parts of this collection fall short of that ideal, there are plenty of chuckles and some beautiful turns of phrase. Poems of joy tend to fare better than the more somber efforts. It is hard to play serious with a style that relies on techniques more common in comedy, such as understatement (\"Another legal situation/ Is death\") and double entendre (\"Try dropping from different heights\"). Regardless, these co-op verses are never less than intriguing.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

He teaches this message in brief prose selections, which he calls \"seeds,\" each of which highlights a particular virtue of monasticism that, if planted in the midst of worldly concerns and nurtured by careful practice, will reach fruition in the soul-centered life. From the example of the monk, as Moore narrates, we learn that a certain kind of work feeds the soul; that we need to become experts in emptiness; and that study amplifies the music of the world.

{"title": "Integrity", "content": " When we talk about character, writes Yale law professor Carter (The Culture of Disbelief), integrity \"is in some sense prior to everything else\"; thus his mix of anecdote and meditation is a worthy but quirky entree to an important yet hard-to-discuss subject. Integrity, he writes, is more than honesty?it requires actions and a willingness to spurn conformity. After his conceptual musings, Carter addresses the role of integrity in performance evaluations (he avoids routine hyperbole), in journalistic objectivity (he thinks the press should apply to itself the standards it applies to others), in law and in sports. Carter virtually ignores the broad question of integrity in business, but he does have interesting, if sometimes convoluted, thoughts on the role of integrity in marriage. He advises caution in legislating integrity in speech or in politics; his arguments spill over, somewhat overambitiously, into suggesting how integrity can help clean up politics (\"We must listen to one another\") and how the concept can help people face larger questions of evil. $50,000 ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Cut off from God and convinced that a secret paramilitary group is on his trail, English arms himself for a violent last stand.

Thus, their parleys tend to center on expressions of and responses to feelings, or what the author labels \"rapport-talk\" (private conversation). Men, on the other hand, use conversation to achieve or maintain social status; they set out to impart knowledge (termed \"report-talk,\" or public speaking). Calling on her research into the workings of dialogue, Tannen examines the functioning of argument and interruption, and convincingly supports her case for the existence of \"genderlect,\" contending that the better we understand it, the better our chances of bridging the communications gap integral to the battle of the sexes.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

A.A.'s approach is patriarchal, okay for affluent white men but not for others, especially women, she finds. The book offers numerous, surprising examples of how A.A. meetings, slogans, traditions and steps hurt women: while it might be good for white men to humble themselves and make amends to everyone, Kasl contends that women should ignore that A.A. exhortation--they've done enough of that sort of thing already.

Ray, a marine biologist, former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, and Washington's governor when Mount St. Helens erupted, has a long history of offending conservationists, and most of this book, written with Guzzo, a writer and adviser to Ray during her governorship, is a recitation of statistics and research studies that prove her points.

Her achievement is to depict the starkly common identity of everyday life in socialist Eastern Europe before its unlamented loss becomes irretrievable. It is a world in which party authority can create the \"sudden invisibility\" for an offending journalist, where public buildings share a \"shabbiness and color of sepia,\" and one that makes the post office an impenetrable \"institution of power.\" The essays are also about people, about the obsessive \" communist eye \" (italics original) disturbed by the injustice of New York's homeless yet neurotically envious of those wearing fur coats at home. The tragic irony lies in the book's title. Hoarding material objects enabled people \"to survive communism,\" but hoarding wartime memories and the inability to \"let the dead be dead\" may destroy the author's native Yugoslavia.

{"title": "The Erotic Mind: Unlocking the Inner Sources of Passion and Fulfillment", "content": " Too many sex therapists focus only on the removal of inhibitions, thus ignoring the complex and paradoxical sources of passion, declares San Francisco-area psychotherapist Morin in this intriguing, insightful mix of analysis, anecdote and advice. Drawing on 351 respondents, straight and gay, who discussed their erotic lives with him, Morin has developed an \"erotic equation\": attraction plus obstacles leads to excitement. This formula, he avers, is neither tidy nor predictable. He suggests that sexual obstacles in one's youth create lifelong scripts for arousal, while a range of feelings?including exuberance, anxiety and anger?can intensify arousal. Morin advises readers to confront the unresolved feelings that produce \"troublesome turn-ons\" and offers a seven-step guide to modifying or expanding one's erotic patterns. In long-term relationships, Morin observes, passion is hardly guaranteed; he advises couples to recognize and address the interactive tension between intimacy and sexual desire. $35,000 marketing campaign; author tour.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"title": "Kings of Cocaine", "content": " In a riveting narrative based on their prize-winning series in the Miami Herald , Gugliotta and Leen expose in alarming, well-documented and vivid detail the estimated $8 billion-a-year Colombian cartel that controls 80% of the world's cocaine market. In their account, the complex hierarchy of the cartel directs an international operation that resembles and surpasses many multinational corporations in efficiency and sophisticated marketing techniques. Run by a small group of murderous young overlords, the organization has thousands of employees--from peasants and pilots to lawyers and hit-men. Initially, corrupt bank and government officials in Colombia favored the cartel's growth. However, this changed after the cartel's successful opposition to an extradition treaty between Colombia and the U.S., which involved a reign of terror against Colombian institutions. The extended activities of the cocaine barons in Central America have compromised U.S. national interests, the authors maintain, especially in the case of reported contra- cartel links and alleged drug trafficking by Panama's Noriega. Despite concerted law enforcement efforts, the cartel still thrives.

{"title": "Sunset Pass", "content": " Our hero, Trueman Rock, returns to the town of Wagontongue after killing a man and an absence of six years. Many things are different, and as he walks down the familiar streets, he notices many changes in buildings and people. This book was originally published in 1931, and it does not boast the complex story line of many of Grey's other works, but the author and narrator Lloyd James have a great ability to draw the listener into Rock's world as he encounters the vile Ash Preston, who is terrorizing Wagontongue and Sunset Pass with an elaborate cattle-rustling operation. In the midst of all of this, Rock falls in love with Thiry Preston, the innocent sister of the bad guy. One of the strong points of this tale is the shining sincerity with which Grey depicts the story of their love. This is a powerful novel of love and loyalty and the depth of our attachment to our homes. James is a fine reader, and this should appeal to everyone, even those who do not normally pick up Westerns.

Inventive, satirical of the contemporary scene, Pratchett does not merely play with words, he juggles shrewd observations with aplomb. His creations are gently allegorical: for instance, the Unseen University Library is the repository of magic, its librarian an orangutan and its archchancellorship reserved for the most powerful magician, a \"sourcerer\" named Coin.

Discussed are Landry's debt to Paul Brown, whose coaching philosophy inspired him, Cowboys owner Clint Murchison and general manager Tex Schramm, who left him free to run the team on the field. We're told that the coach has an introverted personality, which makes many judge him cold and remote.

In addition to the facts of his life, Ramsland analyzes his fiction extensively, drawing parallels between his life and his fiction. Her central idea is that Koontz's traumas as a child are exorcised, to some extent, in his novels.

{"title": "The Abduction", "content": " The presidential election of 2000 is coming down to the wire in this disappointing thriller, when Democratic candidate (and attorney general) Allison Leahy blows a solid lead by refusing to answer the question whether she's ever been unfaithful to her husband. Just as Republican candidate Lincoln Howe (read: Colin Powell) is about to pull ahead, his granddaughter is kidnapped. Leahy's own newly adopted baby daughter was the victim of a similar crime eight years earlier. Are the abductions linked? Is someone connected to either of the candidates responsible? Those are the questions that never quite propel Grippando's latest, after The Informant. While that novel had a strong narrative engine fueled by insider information on the FBI, this one never hits second gear. Neither Leahy nor Howe seems a particularly worthy candidate or likable person, and the possible villains?an ex-boyfriend, a pair of conniving campaign managers, Leahy's tough businessman husband?are equally flat and unconvincing.

The merely modest success of her debut novel leads her back to nonfiction and the possibility of a book about grade school classmate Calliope Jenkins. Accused of murdering her infant son, Jenkins spent seven years in prison steadfastly declining to answer any questions about the disappearance and presumed death of her son. Fallows (white) tries to reconnect with three former classmate friends (black) to compare memories of Jenkins and research her story. In the process, she discovers the gulf (partially racial) that separates her memories of events from theirs.

A hit team's attempt to kill the entire Raab family prompts all of them, except Kate, to start their lives anew in the witness protection program. Kate's choice, predictably, places her in continuing danger, even as she begins to suspect that her father's involvement with the narco traffickers was more deliberate and extensive than he's willing to admit.

The victim, Chr&eacute;tien Leblanc, died without revealing that he was on his way to visit Carpentier, news that comes as a complete shock to the doctor, as the dead man was a stranger to him.

{"title": "Starring You!: The Insiders' Guide to Using Television and Media to Launch Your Brand, Your Business, and Your Life", "content": " The subtext of this media primer for businesspeople by two veterans of various TV shows is far more interesting than the actual content. Not only do the authors take it for granted that most individuals want to appear on television, but they argue that the very skills that position one for a closeup have universal application beyond electronic exposure. Learning to define yourself as a brand, clarify your message, and convince someone that your idea is worth paying attention to (or, eventually paying for) in a crisp, concise way are valuable tools whether you want to get on television, become head of your PTA, or land that dream job, they coo. They lay out a fairly unsurprising collection of lessons such as familiarizing yourself with the shows, creating something pitch-worthy before pitching and respecting the time of those in the business. Interviews with television insiders slow down what is already a tanklike velocity.

{"title": "The Airplane: How Ideas Gave Us Wings", "content": " This history of the development of the airplane by Spenser, a former curator of the National Air and Space Museum and author of747, recasts the Wright brothers' contribution as he widens the scope to aviation history in France, Germany and beyond. Spenser starts with the pioneering work of Yorkshire gentleman Sir George Cayley in the late 18th century, delineates the competitive race between inventors in the early 1900s and culminates (somewhat abruptly) in the world of modern jet airliner travel. Spenser's history reads like a textbook for young, aspiring engineers. Instead of a general chronological approach, Spenser divides the book into sections that each track the development of a different part of the airplane, from the fuselage to landing gear. While this allows him to show how the modern airplane is not a singular invention but rather the cumulative result of thousands of different inventors, trials and errors, it does diffuse the narrative. Still, Spenser's book stands as a smart, and occasionally wonkish, history of a thrilling machine all too often taken for granted.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "The Authenticity Hoax: How We Get Lost Finding Ourselves", "content": " According to Potter (coauthor ofNation of Rebels), the cost of modernity's dismantling of traditional frameworks of truth and meaning has forced meaning and authenticity to become individual searches that are private and consumercentric. Potter's lively cultural analysis combines an astute analysis of foundational antimodernist thought (in particular Rousseau) with savvy surveys of mass culture to flag the pitfalls and ironies of the modern obsession with authenticity in its every incarnation (authentically punk, spiritual, environmentally conscious) from our jeans to our celebrities. Potter champions a mitigation of modernity's negative, alienating effects rather than a rejection of modernity, and his characterizations of antimodernists can be dismissive to the point of oversimplifying a large and varied spectrum of dissent from the status quo. But in redeeming modernity from primitivists, apocalyptic doom-mongers, and more subtle critics, the author offers a shrewd and lively discussion peppered with pop culture references and a stimulating reappraisal of the romantic strain in modern life.(Apr.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For listeners seeking a classic collection of the beloved nursery rhymes, this volume collected by author/artist Engelbreit and read in a bright and inviting tone by Redgrave will be the perfect cup of tea. The British actress is an inspired choice here, providing crisp pronunciation and lilting rhythm throughout.

{"title": "What Every BODY is Saying: An Ex-FBI Agent's Guide to Speed-Reading People", "content": " Adult/High School&mdash;This book illustrates which nonverbal clues telegraph untrustworthiness and deception and which radiate sincerity and compassion. In this fascinating take on body language and the ability to decipher it for use in everyday life, Navarro emphasizes that while knowing the reasons for certain behaviors&mdash;like touching one's neck&mdash;can be useful in \"reading\" people, they are not foolproof barometers of deception. A former FBI agent who commonly used these techniques to help crack cases, the author cautions about jumping to conclusions and encourages using clusters of nonverbal patterns to help discover whether a person is lying or just under stress. One chapter is devoted to the brain and its limbic system, which controls those involuntary quirks of behavior. Black-and-white photos illustrate different points throughout.

No classic detective fiction aficionado will want to miss Upson's compelling sequel to 2008'sAn Expert in Murder, which introduced mystery author Josephine Tey (1896&ndash;1952) as sleuth. In 1935, Tey's close friend, Scotland Yard Inspector Archie Penrose, has returned on holiday to Cornwall, his childhood home, where he ends up attending the funeral of estate worker Harry Pinching, who drowned in Loe Pool, rumored to take a life every seven years. Most locals believe Pinching's death was an accident, but Penrose and Tey, who joins the inspector in Cornwall, soon pick up on ominous undercurrents in the community that suggest otherwise. As the pair attempt to uncover the truth, Penrose witnesses another death that's unquestionably murder. The subtle prose succeeds both at evoking the quiet splendor of the Cornish landscape and in capturing the tragedy and torment that plague many of the characters. The psychological sophistication will resonate with Charles Todd fans.(July)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."}

Masculine women, gorgeous sports cars rich with family history, rugged plains, river currents, stubbornness and entropy wend through this spellbinding collection of ten new and 26 previously published stories from prolific Midwestern author Erdrich (The Plague of Doves). Many of Erdrich's protagonists are American Indians (Chipewa, Kapshaw, and Ojibwe feature prominently) of mixed ancestry (French, German, etc.) and difficult means. Erdrich's character-driven stories are rooted in the mystery of the everyday, stretched across the bones of folklore but cured in the brine of modern life: \"as an Indian,\" Gerry finds it \" difficult... to retain the good humor of his ancestors in these modern circumstances\"; another protagonist concludes that \"the only interesting Indian is dead, or dying by falling backwards off a horse.\" Absurdity and a strained sense of humor keep Eldrich's closely observed tales fresh, making it clear that the life of an \"interesting Indian\" takes many shapes. An exquisite anthology, this volume should cement Erdrich's reputation as one of contemporary America's best short fiction writers.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The author's vignettes make what could be a dry read engaging and urgent. Alden's policy prescriptions are book-ended with the story of Dr. Faiz Bhora, a leading heart surgeon from Pakistan who had trouble returning to the States to resume his work because of visa problems and was eventually caught in the post-9/11 Justice Department crackdown on visa applications by citizens of Muslim countries. Alden points out that the Department of Homeland Security concedes that most of its counterterrorism funds are being poured into securing and controlling the border with Mexico and makes a persuasive case that immigration enforcement and counterterrorism are two different things, and for either to be effective they need to be separated.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Lincoln's Men: The President and His Private Secretaries", "content": " This meticulous triple biography looks at Lincoln's three private secretaries, John Nicolay, John Hay and William O. Stoddard. Closer to Lincoln than almost anyone else, these trusted confidantes and advisers handled all of the president's correspondence, acted occasionally as spies and, between Nicolay and Hay, penned the most famous \"authorized\" biography of Lincoln. Though their experiences in Lincoln's administration cast a poignant, personable light on the great president's working life, Epstein's work is far from accessible. The level of detail regarding the three secretaries is exhaustive beyond the interest of anyone but devoted American history scholars. Author and historian Epstein (Lincoln and Whitman, The Lincolns: Portrait of a Marriage) has intimate knowledge of his subjects but little to drive the story beyond the chronological push of history; meandering from man to man, his narrative isn't cohesive enough to hook casual history readers. Though obsessive Lincoln enthusiasts in search of a new perspective may be fascinated, any number of Lincoln books will offer casual history buffs a more engaging examination.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "God's Battalions: The Case for the Crusades", "content": " It always seems counterintuitive to moderns that warfare and religion can be consistent. Ideally, followers of the prince of peace are to avoid the sword and shield. Clearly, this has not always been the case. Frequently in the crosshairs of critics are the Christian wars against Muslims known as the Crusades, commonly viewed as the birth of European imperialism and the forced spread of Christianity. But what if we've had it all wrong? What if the Crusades were a justifiable response to a strong and determined foe? Stark, a prominent sociologist and author of 27 books on history and religion, has penned a compelling argument that these bloody encounters had less to do with spreading Christianity than with responding to an ever more dangerous enemy&mdash;the emerging Islamic empire. There is much to be learned here. Filled with fascinating historical glimpses of monks and Templars, priests and pilgrims, kings and contemplatives, Stark pulls it all together and challenges us to reconsider our view of the Crusades.(Oct.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The authors assert that after decades of trying to outdo men or fighting the Mommy Wars in the office trenches of the 1980s and 1990s, women have gained enough corporate clout to start changing the workplace to suit their needs. Shipman and Kay review the depth of women's influence as consumers and earners, maintaining that their power gives them the right and the ability to ask for flexibility in their work lives, to negotiate assertively and effectively, to say no and to give up the guilt associated with getting their needs met. Through Shipman and Kay's own stories of struggling with demanding work and home lives and anecdotes from other working mothers, the authors make a convincing argument that with some mental and emotional effort, women can create their ideal work and home lives.

With the end of the Cold War, spies on both sides of the Iron Curtain discovered there was money to be made renting out their skills to clients in such fields as pharmaceuticals, banking, and agriculture. Although the historical sections can drag in places, the book gathers steam every time Javers turns his focus to the technologies that have moved the field forward. From early wiretaps to the use of satellites, the author expertly explains how spies help clients sabotage corporate competitors or buy and sell stocks based on expected fluctuations in the price of corn. Generally more interested in strategy and gadgets than the ethical components of spying, the book flirts with painting a romantic picture of the profession before noting the less-than-glamorous occupations of corporate spies, including participating in the battle for supremacy in the pet food market.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book picks up in a section on media, where the author finally launches a fascinating discussion of how businesses&mdash;especially media and entertainment industries&mdash;can continue to evolve and profit by using Google's strategies.

{"title": "The Official CIA Manual of Trickery and Deception", "content": " Intelligence historian Melton and retired CIA officer Wallace (coauthors ofSpycraft) reunite for this unremarkable reproduction of a long-lost cold war&ndash;era relic. In 1953, the fledgling CIA hired professional magician John Mulholland to adapt his techniques of stealth and misdirection to the craft of espionage. Mulholland produced two illustrated manuals featuring a range of tricks from placing pills into drinks to stealing documents and avoiding detection. The classified manuals were believed to have been destroyed in 1973, but the authors discovered a copy in 2007 among recently declassified CIA archives. The manuals are reproduced along with enhanced illustrations and an extended introduction by Melton and Wallace. Despite the authors' best efforts to promote their discovery of Mulholland's work as a rare piece of historical evidence of the CIA's legacy of black arts, the manuals, with their earnest, how-to descriptions of surreptitiously spiking drinks, palming documents and signaling colleagues with a feather in a hat band seem more quaintly anachronistic than revealing or sinister.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

That, in a nutshell, is the message of this volume on building Christian character by Wright, a prodigiously prolific Bible scholar and Anglican bishop of Durham, England. In arguing for this new vision of virtue, which is a vision of Jesus Christ himself, Wright carefully explores such classical exponents of character as Aristotle. He also acknowledges the existence of other notions of encouraging behavior-based rules, duty, or being true to oneself. Drawing on scriptures from Genesis to Revelation, Wright asserts that true transformation comes through the work of the Holy Spirit and through worship, mission, and following Jesus. As the habits of virtue grow, the church community will become the royal priesthood it is meant to be, anticipating (one of the author's favorite words) God's coming new world. A follow-up to Wright'sSimply ChristianandSurprised by Hope, this solid volume will appeal to Christians who appreciate biblical interpretation that hews to tradition but incorporates an emphasis on contemporary social justice as an element of Christian virtue.(Mar.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Home Repair", "content": " Rosenberg, a poet and children's book author, makes a clean break into adult fiction with the story of a middle-aged woman whose journey to independence begins at a garage sale. Forty-six-year-old Eve's garage sale takes an unexpected turn when her husband, Chuck, goes on an errand and never comes back, leaving Eve to raise teenage son Marcus and nine-year-old daughter Noni. Drawing support from her sometimes helpful mother, old friends at the university where she works and new friends&mdash;such as the man she meets in the park and a Korean graduate student and his non&ndash;English-speaking wife&mdash;Eve discovers the locals offer all she needs in her life. Rosenberg achieves remarkable emotional range&mdash;comic to tragic, dysfunction to triumph, irony to wisdom&mdash;for an engaging, often touching story of survival on a heartbreak diet.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "In Praise of Doubt: How to Have Convictions Without Becoming a Fanatic", "content": " Sociologists Berger (The Social Construction of Reality) and Zijderveld (The Abstract Society) inveigh against the dogma of isms that replace humor with certainty and thoughtfulness with blind action. Between the extremes of fundamentalism and moral relativism sits the doubter, perched on liberal democracy, which the authors describe as a three-legged stool, balanced on the state, civil society and the market economy to promote debate and dissent. Berger and Zijderveld illustrate the obvious perils of extremism, but are less adept at navigating moderation. They apply their doubt premise to abortion, capital punishment and immigration policy, and come to inoffensively moderate political positions, but their tepid recommendations lack appeal; as the authors admit, The agnostic position is by definition a weak one. What recommends doubt as a concept is that it defies stringent characterization. Yet in both style and approach, the authors belie the vigorousness of their position&mdash;and an important position it is.(Aug.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Born to Kill: The Rise and Fall of America's Bloodiest Asian Gang", "content": " This sociological study and true-crime expose tells of the rootless young Vietnamese males sent out of the country by their families as the Saigon regime was collapsing and, after months or years in refugee camps, placed with foster families in the U.S. Some of these youths became the nucleus of New York City's Chinatown Born to Kill gang and were as violent as their name suggests. They made money \"protecting\" merchants and through holdups and invasions of homes, and their victims were always other Asians. One of their number, Tinh Ngo, was repelled by the gang's bloodthirstiness and became a police informant. Thanks to him and to city and federal officers, seven of the gang were apprehended, tried in 1992 and given long prison sentences, the leader, David Thai, getting life.

{"title": "Keep the Change: A Clueless Tipper's Quest to Become the Guru of the Gratuity", "content": " The concept of gratuity is the subject of this second book from the unmasked author of Waiter Rant and, like his first, has its own lad-lit charms and contrivances. Opening with a broad and light cultural history of tipping, the book then delves briefly into the tip's primary restaurant industry role before moving on to its impact in lesser known and often neglected businesses by examining their gratuity-related transactions. There's enough raw, self-deprecating autobiography to keep the anthropological enterprise comic; in addition, the author steps in the shoes of those in various industries and discloses the hidden codes of parking valets, Starbucks \"tip jars,\" and the beauty industry. Dublanica breaks down a dizzying variety of service-related exchanges along with the inner worlds of casino dealers and sex-trade workers (in fact, there's an awful lot about Vegas) and even provides a couple of tip-helpful appendixes.

{"title": "Red November: Inside the Secret U.S.-Soviet Submarine War", "content": " Reed's personal experience as a navy recon diver, submarine weapons technician, and special ops photographer informs every page of this exhaustive and fascinating account of submarine technology and warfare from the end of WWII through the cold war. The author's father, William J. Reed, a navy communications specialist, helped develop the hardware that made possible long distance frequency direction finding that allowed listening stations to pinpoint the far away locations of ships or submarines. These HFDF stations, called \"Huff Duffs,\" were instrumental in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. Reed presents a vast cast of interesting characters and a daunting array of scientific technology, but manages to keep the material understandable, fresh, and exciting as befits a book devoted to the underwater world of high stakes submarine warfare. Decades-long gag orders keep participants from revealing really up-to-date secrets, though it's chilling to learn that from 1995 to 2005 the Chinese navy has launched 31 nuclear submarines.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Maeve's story begins when she loses her job and vows to stop being flighty and irresponsible (flitterdegibbety). With her talking cockatiel in tow, Maeve heads west from the Carolinas, planning to reconnect with a friend who's found success in Hollywood. Her plan is predictably derailed when her car breaks down outside the town of Unknown, Ariz., where she's embraced by the locals and takes on a series of jobs&mdash;in a funky boarding house, at a bookstore owned by a handsome children's book author, at the local photo shop&mdash;while waiting on auto repairs. Chronic hypochondria leads her to seek out the town's doctor, and before long they begin a comfortable romance.

St. Claire's sister has died of a shotgun blast to the head in Georgia, a death ruled a suicide by the local authorities, but St. Claire suspects her brother-in-law killed her sister. Brockton's efforts to preserve evidence that could support St. Claire's theory ends up taking a backseat to another puzzle, based on events at an actual Florida reform school, where boys were routinely physically abused. Realistic descriptions of forensic work compensate only in part for less than convincing action sequences. Bass is the writing team of Bill Bass, the real-life model for Brockton, and Jon Jefferson.

Though Herendeen claims she's merely unearthed the hidden story from clues already written into the original, what unquestionably occurs in this unlikely redo is erotic, witty and as often silly as refreshing. Here, Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy match wits and sexual appetites while engaging in same-sex relationships, she with older-and-wiser Charlotte, he with younger and pliable Charles Bingley, who struggles with his attraction to Elizabeth's sister, Jane. Sure, the permutations make the already complicated plot even more convoluted, but the sex&mdash;hokey as it is with all the pulsing and throbbing&mdash;helps ease the prideful misunderstandings and ignorant prejudices.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Dearest Cousin Jane: A Jane Austen Novel", "content": " Jane Austen, along with her family, once again feature prominently in Pitkeathley's latest romantic, meticulously researched period melodrama. This time around, Austen's glamorous cousin Countess Eliza de Feuillide (once known as simply Betsy) takes center stage. Suggesting that Eliza made a significant impression on Jane's development as an author, Pitkeathley depicts a spirited woman who certainly made an impact on the entire Austen clan, as well as stole her share of hearts, including her first husband Jean Capot, the Comte de Feuillide, who was guillotined in 1794. Pitkeathley (Cassandra and Jane) explores several impressions of Eliza, who ultimately married Jane's brother Henry, through the various perspectives Austen family members; while Jane's is naturally appealing, Eliza's viewpoint is far more fascinating, especially as she worries about her impending death from breast cancer.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The author makes a cogent case against several misguided government policies, from destructive urban renewal schemes to asbestos-abatement hysteria, but inflates the particulars into an attack on liberal \"rationalism,\" the desire to use reason to solve human problems and a refusal to acknowledge that \"this is not a universe governed by logic.\" Insufficient citations and such claims as \"no one goes without  care\" in the U.S.\" sap the book's authority and might well prevent Dunn's own \"well-meaning\" arguments from finding wider credence.

{"title": "Unless It Moves the Human Heart: The Craft and Art of Writing", "content": " Culled from his experiences teaching writing workshops, novelist, essayist, and longtime professor Rosenblatt (Making Toast) tackles the \"why\"--not the \"how\"--of writing by chronicling his winter/spring 2008 semester of \"Writing Everything,\" wherein students discuss and write short stories, essays, and poetry. Chapters include these students' work; Rosenblatt's humor, wit, and wisdom; and classroom discussions of questions both obvious (how does a story differ from an essay?) and remarkably precise (how does James Joyce convey so much in the first sentence of \"Clay\" and what does it all mean?). The author repeatedly points out that he cannot teach his students to be professional writers, but rather to simply write better than they did before. Less a how-to book than a measured reflection on teaching, the work nonetheless offers aspiring writers many concrete suggestions (let your nouns do the work; go for imagination over invention; write with \"restraint, precision, and generosity\"). And the oft-invoked words of other authors should resonate with readers and writers alike. (Jan.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.  All rights reserved."}
{"title": "What He's Poised to Do: Stories", "content": " Fourteen very self-conscious stories from Greenman (Please Step Back) demonstrate the author's easy hand with formal manipulation, though his command over emotional terrain proves to be circumspect. The collection is bracketed by two very short stories (the title story and Her Hand) built around picture postcards (indeed, postmarks appear at the beginning of each story), and the varied stories between them all move with transparency; Greenman's prose is polished to a fine gloss that handily guides the reader along. While some stories only get a few details&mdash;two stories with cloyingly cute and very long titles are among the shortest; their titles virtual punch lines&mdash;others spin on, dominated less by substance than by stylistic demands, as with Seventeen Different Ways to Get a Load of That, which documents a relationship breakdown in short numbered cuts. The strongest story, What We Believe We Cannot Praise, about changing dynamics at a law firm, hints at Greenman's talent and begs for a longer treatment than it gets in this chilly if playful collection.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "American Uprising: The Untold Story of America's Largest Slave Revolt", "content": " This study of a January 1811 slave uprising and march on New Orleans exhumes the deliberately obscured and \"largest act of armed resistance against slavery in the history of the United States.\" Historian Rasmussen expands on scarce source material to provide a complex context for a revolt that dwarfed such better-known rebellions as Nat Turner's and Denmark Vesey's, a stealthily organized uprising of 500 armed slaves dressed in military uniforms marching on and trying to conquer New Orleans. The author ties together diverse political, economic, and cultural threads in describing the rise (and brutal suppression) of the \"ethnically diverse, politically astute, and highly organized\" army, and investigates why this \"story more Braveheart than Beloved\" was consigned to historical footnote. While the book's ambition occasionally exceeds its grasp, it vividly evokes the atmosphere of New Orleans of the early 19th century and how a recalcitrant, French-rooted Louisiana and some Spanish possessions in the Deep South were incorporated into the expanding American nation though brutal revenge justice and political pressures.

With Obama's cabinet, Hodge says, we saw that \"change\" was not on the table so much as continuity, that  the health care reform bill proved a disappointment, and that the military situation remains the same. Furthermore, Obama's \"record on torture, detention, and executive authority is even worse,\" and \"our constitutional system may never recover.\" Hodge, former editor in chief of Harper's Magazine, supports his arguments with lengthy discussion of historical politics, from the founding fathers through the Clinton and Bush administrations, and ends with a call to voters \"to alter its mode of government\" and \"provide new guards for our future security.\" Hodge's first book will interest a broad audience, from activists seeking to change the \"political will\" to academics seeking historical context.(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Beginning with his strong-willed family\"The ill luck principle applied here with a vengeance\"he recalls his roots, his origins among a people who knew hardship. His entrance into the Jesuit community was both a withdrawal from that life and a wondrous opening to another. In the long period of preparation for priesthood, Berrigan blossomed as teacher, poet, charismatic leader of college students, notably on the Cornell campus. Paying tribute to Dorothy Day and to her style of Christian community that influenced him, he describes his soul as \"moving in a contrary wind.\" His acts of civil disobedience with his brother Philip, also a priest, their arrests and convictions, are well known. Today, Berrigan, a member of the Jesuit community in New York City, remains actively engaged in social causes.

{"title": "Transformation: Understanding the Three Levels of Masculine Consciousness", "content": " On the heels of Robert Bly's best-selling Iron John ( LJ 11/15/90), comes this slim volume which offers quite a different assessment of maleness and its self-completion. Johnson, author of Inner Work ( LJ 7/86) and We ( LJ 2/1/84), uses three literary archetypes: Don Quixote (simple, two-dimensional man); Hamlet (complex, four-dimensional man); and Faust (complete, four-dimensional man). As a result of modern education and urbanization, Johnson posits, Western man is no longer simple; yet he lacks self-determination and therefore is trapped. The insights found here seem applicable to universal self-fulfillment and provocation (e.g., what significance does Faust's victory over the devil hold for men in these AIDS-ridden, economically troubled times?). Also, where Bly's book demands action, Johnson's is purely cerebral and more interesting to readers familiar with classic literature.- David Nudo, New YorkCopyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

{"title": "Facing Codependence: What It Is, Where It Comes from, How It Sabotages Our Lives", "content": " This book stands out among the current glut of material on codependence because it claims the realm of parenting for its vantage point. The authors believe that codependents must heal themselves in order not to repeat the \"less than nurturing\" behaviors of their own addicted or emotionally dysfunctional parents. Hence, they couple strategies for recovery with guidelines on what is and is not \"normal\" in the parent-child relationship. The authors' conclusions will invite controversy; for instance, they suggest that \"emotional sexual abuse\" of children may lead to homosexuality in adulthood. Nor are they reluctant to generalize: \"Although physical and mental illness aren't addictions, their effect on the family is the same.\" Offsetting the opinionated commentary is great compassion for the helpless, hurt children who live inside adult codependents.

Their captivating study amplifies key Mesoamerican mythic narratives, hymns and prayers with 100 reproductions (25 in color) of ancient ceramics, stone sculptures, paintings, monuments and masks. Beginning with simple yet profound female figurines, this panoramic survey moves on to the Great Mother Goddess, hero twins, feathered serpents, were-jaguars and the fourfold development of the gods, the cosmos and humans from the unity of the creative principle. The Markmans, who cowrote Masks of the Spirit: Image and Metaphor in Mesoamerica , take readers inside a strange yet exalted universe whose inhabitants--mythic and human--participated in a cyclic drama of death and regeneration.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"title": "Owning Your Own Shadow: Understanding the Dark Side of the Psyche", "content": " The shadow in Jungian psychology is the unconscious dumping ground for undesirable characteristics of personality. \"Owning\" the shadow--accepting it as part of one's self--is seen as the first step toward wholeness. Using examples from history, mythology, and religion, Johnson, author of Inner Work ( LJ 7/86) and Transformation ( LJ 8/91), offers a tour of the shadow, showing its origin and features, and demonstrating how and why it bursts into consciousness when least expected. Returning to the subject of his earlier work We ( LJ 2/1/84), the author reveals how experience of romantic love may lead to awareness of both positive and negative aspects of the shadow, and how integrating the shadow into one's personality can be a challenging religious experience. This clearly written, thought-provoking work is recommended for academic and public libraries.- Lucille Boone, San Jose P.L., Cal.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"title": "The universe story: From the primordial flaring forth to the ecozoic era--a celebration of the unfolding of the cosmos", "content": " Physicist Swimme ( The Universe is a Green Dragon ) and historian/theologian Berry ( The Dream of Earth ) fashion a cosmology with alternating chapters of popular astrophysics and a kind of sociology of science that seems, at the start, like a secular Book of Genesis. The admixture of physics and anthropology soon decays into an artificial comprehension akin to the most irresponsible New Age reasoning. In the \"Primordial Flaring Forth\" section, the authors discuss their perceived need for a new language to express a current cosmology: \"Thus to articulate anew the story of our relationships in the world means to use the words of one of the modern languages that implicitly, and to varying degrees, obscures or even denies the reality of these emerging relationships.\" Offering evidence that, among other things, first cousins should not marry, this soft union of theology and physics reveals less about the universe than either field can by itself. The writers' tortured prose will likely offend the scientific sensibilities of most general readers.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "The Original New Testament: A Radical Translation and Reinterpretation", "content": " The author of The Passover Plot offers a translation of the entire New Testament (the first one-man translation since J.B. Phillips's version.) As one would expect, there are controversial elements in the translation itself and in the introductions. For example, attempting to be completely objective, Schonfield avoids certain well-established but ecclesiastically ``overloaded'' terms, such as supervisor for bishop and envoy for apostle. However, supervisor and envoy are not neutral terms; they have their own connotations. A one-man translation will not rival the significance of the ``official'' translations, but because of Schonfield's reputation this present work should achieve some popularity. Comparing it with the ``official'' translations will give a fresh experience of the New Testament text. John Moryl, Yeshiva Univ. Lib., New YorkCopyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Faces of the Enemy: Reflections of the Hostile Imagination", "content": " Each nation seeks to justify warfare by creating a monstrous image of its enemy. Killing is made a source of pride, murder a patriotic duty; war becomes a holy war \"with God on our side.\" Keen (The Passionate Life uses political posters and cartoons to demonstrate that belligerent countries have consistently characterized the enemy as aggressor, barbarian, devil, rapist, insect, germ. Noting that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. need to view one another as evil, he urges a massive overhaul of fixed postures and attitudes. His \"potpourri of possibilities\" to eradicate deep-seated hate and fear ranges from cultural exchanges to divestment of empires (ours and theirs). Illustrated with color and black-and-white art, this original probe of the root causes of war offers a new perspective on ways to thaw the Cold War.

But with the help of family, friends and her own inner resources, she was finally able to put her life back together. Then, however, she was faced with another test: her daughter Nichole's alcoholism. But this time, from her reserves of spiritual strength, Beattie met the problem head-on.

{"title": "Undercurrents: A Life Beneath the Surface", "content": " Manning, a clinical psychologist, led a busy life as therapist, mother and psychology professor at George Mason University in Virginia when, in 1990, she sank into crippling depression. Obsessed with images of death and plagued by suicidal thoughts, she vainly sought relief through antidepressants and psychiatric counseling. Simmering with misplaced anger at her husband, Brian, and fearful that their daughter, Keara, could not rely on her, Manning finally agreed to her psychiatrist's recommendation to submit to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In this sensitive journal covering the period 1990-1991, she credits electroshock with lifting her out of a life-threatening depression, though she concedes that it caused some memory loss and confusion. She also continues to cope with much smaller depressions and may have to take antidepressants or lithium for the rest of her life. Her edgy self-portrait will probably fuel the debate over a controversial therapy. $75,000 ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"title": "The 22 Non-Negotiable Laws of Wellness: Take Your Health into Your Own Hands to Feel, Think, and Live Better Than You Ev", "content": " Long-term lung cancer survivor Anderson (The Cancer Conqueror) believes that wellness and illness are not just conditions experienced by individuals but are expressions of whole persons functioning in a range of contexts: in their society, among their co-workers, with their family and friends. His holistic approach to wellness addresses attitudes and core beliefs, vocation and emotion, as well as physical habits and nutrition. The advice is sound and sometimes unexpected: \"stress is to be not only expected but preferred.... The problem isn't stress, it's toxic stress.\" Despite the rigid connotation of the title, these \"laws\" are generous and encouraging, reflecting Anderson's accessible presentation of material in aphoristic, anecdotal chapters. This inspirational guide sometimes lacks subtlety, but it doesn't harangue and is filled with inspiring verbal snapshots of people whose lives have been enriched by adopting the practices and beliefs explicated here.

{"title": "Inner Bonding: Becoming a Loving Adult to Your Inner Child", "content": " This work teaches us to connect our inner adult (logical conscious mind) with our inner child (instinctual or gut feelings) so that we may live conflict-free lives. Paul has worked extensively with this form of psychotherapy, which she calls inner bonding, and is the author of several books on the subject. Through loving behavior and acknowledgment of that \"voice\" within ourselves, the author claims that we can satisfy our own needs and not be totally dependent on others for happiness. She gives examples through her counseling work with those who want better family, marital, social, and work relationships and encourages outside help for special problems such as alcoholism, sex addiction, and codependency. This is a very helpful book for both individuals and couples who want to learn how to acknowledge their inner needs and address fears and false beliefs that often stem from childhood.

{"title": "Escape from Intimacy: Untangling the ``Love'' Addictions: Sex, Romance, Relationships", "content": " Sexual addiction, in Schaef's diagnosis, comes in many guises: an obsession with erotic activities, lust, child molesting, incest or an \"anorexic\" distaste for matters sexual. Besides sex addicts, Schaef ( Women's Reality ) here profiles two other types of addicts: \"romance junkies,\" who seek escape from true intimacy through pseudo-relationships, and \"relationship addicts\"preoccupied with a particular person or with the need to have a relationship, real or fantasied. A former psychotherapist, Schaef insists that addictive ties are reinforced by underlying sick tendencies in our frantic, competitive culture. Romance addicts, for example, mesh with society's illusionary focus, which reinforces their avoidance of life's hard realities. The author outlines a 12-step program for recovery from self-destructive personal addictions. Her levelheaded yet powerful analysis holds up a startling mirror in which many readers will see themselves.

Codependent people find themselves obsessed in often futile ways with controlling someone who repeatedly makes trouble for him- or herself or others. Few people understand this idea as well as Melody Beattie, an author recovering successfully from a variety of addictive disorders and entanglements. In this popular work, she combines real-life stories with lucid explanations of the concepts that define every part of the codependent syndrome. Delivered by the incomparable Gabrielle de Cuir, the program paints a coherent, enlightening picture and offers many constructive ideas for people stuck in a codependent pattern.

{"title": "Embracing Fear:  and Finding the Courage to Live Your Life", "content": " As with most popular books written by therapists, Rutledge's  includes many anecdotes from his practice. Unlike most, his  examples are equally balanced, with accounts of his own  challenges and recoveries. As a recovering alcoholic and a  therapy patient himself, as well as a syndicated columnist and  national lecturer, Rutledge is uniquely qualified to give advice  about overcoming fear and addiction. Although the writing is not  exciting, it is simple and accessible to most readers; Rutledge  expresses his opinions very candidly. The book lacks the  \"how-to\" call-out boxes and \"to do\" lists that break up the text  in many other psychology books, but the author does share with  us a few tools he uses, such as the metaphors of facing the wall  and going down the rungs of a ladder, the FEAR acronym, and the  identification of \"the bully\" and \"the ally.\" Recommended for  all public library psychology collections.

Roth (architecture, Univ. of Oregon) argues that architecture does more than provide shelter; it is also a physical expression of how people view themselves in relation to each other and to the universe. Part 1 provides a solid introduction to the discipline's form and function; Part 2 focuses on the major buildings, styles, and architects from prehistoric times to the present, with a valuable historical overview opening each chapter.

{"title": "The Methodologies Of Art: An Introduction", "content": " Because works of art can be interpreted in a variety of ways, this book surveys \"methodologies,\" diverse approaches to artistic analysis used by art historians, philosophers, and critics to enlighten viewers. The author, whose works include Art and Psychoanalysis (LJ 9/15/93) and A History of Western Art (LJ 3/15/94), then relates these methods to masterpieces of Western art. Adams's well-crafted, thoughtful essays consider biography and the presence of such artists as Gauguin, van Eyck, and Raphael in their paintings; Marxist readings of Giotto and Delacroix; a deconstructionist analysis of van Gogh's \"Shoes\"; the feminist approach to O'Keeffe and Chicago; a Freudian analysis of Donatello's \"David\"; and much more. With 70 black-and-white photos and four color plates, this is a good choice for introductory college art history courses.

In the center of each page, the text elaborates on the importance of the item in early American life. The bottom illustration features a close-up view of a single section as well as a drawing of the entire quilt. The variety of colors and designs makes the quilts themselves the real stars of the book and will certainly inspire some readers to accept the author's suggestion to search for more patchwork schemes.

Active and stylish, Grandma Nan demands a neat room and strictly nutritious meals. Laid-back and cozy Grandma Sal would rather watch the ball game with her feet up, or offer Gummy Bearsstet caps before lunch. Pip is uncomfortable with the opposing forces. \"I want to do things OUR way, like everyday when Mom and Dad are home,\" he asserts.

The tale opens with a hearing in which John Cotton questions him and concludes with the founding of Providence, Rhode Island. As might be expected in a 48-page book for beginning readers, the portrait Avi draws is necessarily sketchy: only the high points of Williams's character and beliefs are covered. Nonetheless, he does capture some of the man's integrity and convictions. And by placing the voice of the story with Williams's young daughter, the author conveys some of the poignancy of the situation. Although some of the character's features are blurry, the full- and half-page watercolor illustrations are realistic and balance the text nicely.

Such literal mindedness is what gives Amelia her charm, and there are plenty of instances of humorous confusion in this latest installment in the series.

That's a lot to explain in a short book, and some of these concepts are difficult to simplify. To her credit, Bradley, the author ofEnergy Makes Things Happen(2003), does grapple with fundamental concepts rather than taking the easier, more traveled, less-satisfactory road of, say, talking about gravity in terms of \"up\" and \"down\" or simply describing its observable effects.

The African-American Struggle for Freedom", "content": " Combining the emotional and plot-weaving powers of his novelist talents with a strong author's presence, Myers portrays the quests of individual Africans against the background of broader historical movements. Instead of a comprehensive, strict chronology, Myers offers, through freed slave Ibrahima, investigative reporter Ida Wells, artist Meta Warrick Fuller, inventor George Latimore, artist Dred Scott, the 54th Massachusetts Regiment and others, history at its best--along with deeper understanding of past and contemporary events.

{"title": "All by Myself!", "content": " A perky preschooler (or kindergartner) flies solo through his daily routine in this upbeat offering, which begins with a wake-up visit from the boy's pet cat. As the child washes up, gets dressed, eats breakfast, plays at school, goes to the library, etc., he is pictured on his own. Only in frames depicting his drop-off at and pickup from school and at bedtime do his parents appear. The parents' limited role reinforces the book's celebration of children's independence, even if it sometimes presents a skewed perspective of age-appropriate autonomy. The text is simple and the picture clues are ample, but the verse's rhythm and rhyme scheme are intermittently forced (e.g., \"Right shoe, left shoe. Tie, comb, done! Breakfast's ready, pour, crunch, yum!\"). Aliki's (William Shakespeare & the Globe) brightly hued, unadorned art convincingly conveys the protagonist's high energy and enthusiasm. A cheerful if minor addition to the author/artist's oeuvre. Ages 3-6. (Sept.)Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition."}

{"title": "Career in C Major and Other Fiction", "content": " Cain (18921977) is best known for The Postman Always Rings Twice, Double Indemnity and Mildred Pierce, in which lower-class characters suffer answered prayers. After years of writing highly colored features and stories for various journals, Cain became a star with Postman in 1934. He disliked the \"hard-boiled\" label and his authorized biographer Hoopes subtitles his introduction \"Was the 'Tough Guy' Really a Humorist at Heart?\" On the basis of these previously uncollected pieces, the reader can give only a qualified assent. The \"dialogues,\" satires about state and local government which he wrote for the American Mercury, have a bitter edge, and the \"light fiction\" pieces, mainly about Hollywood, are slight indeed. The title novella, about a contractor who becomes an opera singer, is rather funny but segues into a sentimental ending that rings false. Cain does show a deep interest in and knowledge of music, proving that he wasn't completely a tough guy. 12,500 first printing.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

House sizes range from 570 to 3100 square feet, and there is a great variety in style and environment. A 19-page section about the author's own small residence offers an in-depth look at one design.

Taking into account that feminism has altered the dynamic between the sexes, Farrell claims that in their relationships both sexes would like to \"have it all,\" but that their realities and fantasies diverge widelyfantasies that, he contends, are exploited by advertising, magazines, romance novels, movies and TV, working at both conscious and unconscious levels. These media intensify men's compulsion to perform in sports, at sex and on the job, often masking deep insecurity and vulnerability, the author maintains. To achieve intimacy and balance in a relationship, he counsels, both men and women must not only share risks but learn to promote growth in the other, rather than nurture deficiencies.

{"title": "Breaking the Mob, true story of a dedicated cop", "content": " A former Philadelphia police captain who rose through the ranks and headed his city's Organized Crime Task Force, Friel played a major role in the breakup of the Nicky Scarfo Mafia family. The Scarfo mob, originally based in the City of Brotherly Love, expanded its focus to include Atlantic City when legalized gambling was approved for the seaside resort. Scarfo, a violent and unpredictable man, had taken over after his two predecessors were murdered within a year; his ascendance set off a wave of killings. Collaborating with Guinther ( Brotherhood of Murder ), Friel tells how police work brought the don and dozens of his underlings to justice in 1989. The book also details Friel's own successful effort to free a wrongly convicted man from death row. But what makes the book especially noteworthy are the authors' insights into the psychology of mobsters and their recommendations for increased efficiency in fighting the drug war, especially interagency cooperation.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

The book reflects a definite operations bias. Indeed, Imai advocates the removal of all those peripheral things (muda) that cloud the focus of an organization. Some of the principles, such as the need for good housekeeping, seem simplistic, but Imai is on solid ground, demonstrating the practicality of gemba kaizen with a number of abbreviated case studies.

A chapter on ending friendships (\"A mature person manages to grow both roots and wings\") is particularly illuminating. Not surprisingly, Pogrebin, one of the founding editors of Ms. magazine, and the author of Growing up Free, a blueprint for nonsexist childrearing, \"welcomes any sign of a breakdown between categories, be they racial or gender categories or the rigid dividing lines between the personal and professional aspects of our lives.\" She devotes the bulk of her book to exploring and encouraging alliances that bridge these gaps, as well as the boundaries of age, sexual preference, socio-economic levels and disability. She comes down hard on male friendship for a lack of intimacy but cautions that women sometimes become \"relationship-junkies.\" Throughout, the provocative thesis is enlivened with anecdotes, perceptively reasoned and well-documented, although some of the research is overwhelming. 50,000 first printing; $50,000 ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Fortified with unlimited broker deposits, the network plundered hundreds of federally insured thrifts. The authors discount the role of high oil prices, the Sunbelt recession and other factors as catalysts in the S & L disaster. Excepting Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman Erwin Gray, who fought to limit deposit brokerage, Pizzo, Fricker and Muolo accuse the Justice Department, the courts and other federal and state agencies for ignoring or covering up four years of fraud.

With coauthor Stainback (Snake, etc.), Robinson discusses racism in the diamond sport, which he experienced in the minor leagues (he could not stay in the same hotels as his teammates), in the major leagues (he found virtually no off-the-field contact between black and white players) and in the front office. He also deals with the problems of drug abuse and cheating by pitchers and batters, both of which he considers widespread and about which he claims that those in positions of power do nothing.

The attempt does not succeed, partly because, as the author himself notes, his subjects are \"mediocre, shallow people without imagination, courage or initiative.\" His interviews with three former concentration camp commandants are unmemorable except for the moment when one breaks into sobs in self-pity over his postwar years in an Allied prison. The author's interviews with widows and children of former commandants are even less revealingmany tell him basically the same thing: there was no such thing as the Holocaust, and my husband (or father) was certainly not a party to it. The book, however, contains interesting material from the Berlin Documentary Center: details of recruitment, indoctrination and training of SS officers (the commandants were all members of Himmler's army-within-an-army) including official texts from a program designed to strengthen anti-Semitic consciousness.

Mark is a consultant specializing in business strategy and brand management. Pearson's work is based on Jungian psychology, which holds that archetypes are forms or images of a collective nature, which occur not only as myths but also as individual products of the unconscious. Using examples from advertising and marketing and consumer, popular, and organizational culture, she and Mark show that successful brands draw on responses to such archetypes as the hero, outlaw, lover, sage, magician, creator, and innocent, and that these responses cross lifestyle and cultural boundaries. They examine ways to determine which archetypal meaning is best for one's brand and provide a model for doing so.David RouseCopyright &#169; American Library Association. All rights reserved"}

Drawing both from the literature of cross-cultural studies and from the experience of their practice, the authors (who are business consultants) take the fascinating approach of breaking the complexities of cultural differences into value orientations, put in the context of ten variables: environment, time, action, communication, space, power, individualism, competitiveness, structure, and thinking. The resulting framework offers readers systematic guidance on how to put in perspective the many factors and variations of cross-cultural issues.

{"title": "Why Boys Don't Talk - and Why it Matters", "content": " This book explores the reticence of boys: what it signifies and how to decipher the meanings behind the silence. The book emphasizes the importance of staying connected to children as they grow into adolescence. Shaffer, an educator, and Gordon, a clinical social worker, explain the cultural and social constraints behind boys' unwillingness to talk. Fearful of the appearance of vulnerability, boys aren't willing to risk exposure of their feelings by talking and instead use competitiveness as an acceptable model for expressing emotions. The authors provide strategies for enhancing opportunities to connect more deeply and emotionally with boys and explore the cultural conventions regarding ideals of masculinity, encouraging parents to help teens develop more independent and individual self-images. Particular issues facing boys of color are addressed in separate chapters. The authors also offer specific strategies: for instance,  boys need to be taught empathy; and parents need to value attachment in their sons as well as their daughters.Vanessa BushCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

{"title": "Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns", "content": " It's no secret that people learn in different ways, so why, the authors of this book ask, \"can't schools customize their teaching?\" The current system, \"designed for standardization,\" must by its nature ignore the individual needs of each student. The answer to this problem, the authors argue, is \"disruptive innovation,\" a principle introduced (and initially applied to business) by Harvard Business School professor Christensen in The Innovator's Dilemma. The idea is that an audience in need will benefit from even a faulty opportunity to fulfill that need; in education, the demand for individual instruction could be met through infinitely customizable online computer-based instruction. The authors, all professionals in education, present a solution to the ills of standardized education that's visionary but far-fetched; even they admit that their recommendations would be extremely difficult to implement in current school systems. Still, the authors' unusual case, though occasionally bogged down in tangents, is worthy reading for school administrators, teachers, parents and, perhaps most of all, software developers.

Now living in exile in Paris, he breaks his long-held silence to expose the dealings of three U.S. presidents with the Iranians as well as to describe the duplicity of Khomeini, who the author argues betrayed the spirit of the revolution. Bani-Sadr claims that the Reagan election team conspired with the Iranians to withhold the release of the hostages until after the election, thus permitting Reagan to claim the credit. He also makes some interesting comments about the involvement of Reagan and Bush in the Iran-contra arms scandal.

A sad story about the hazards of drinking coffee (it spilled--and the prospect was then distracted by a second crisis) is followed by a notice not to eat a major meal during a sales lunch, which is promptly followed by \"no pen in the shirt pocket\" advice.

{"title": "Martin Misunderstood", "content": " Who'd have thought that the disrespect and indignities Wayne Knight suffered as Newman on theSeinfeldseries would have been just a warmup for the silly, tasteless and at times repugnant, racist and unfunny material that Slaughter has provided. The author's original audio novella focuses on murder suspect Martin Reed, an &uuml;ber-wimp who lives with his shrewish, nagging nightmare of a mother and who works at Southern Toilet Supply. His home life is an indication of Slaughter's originality; his occupation suggests the level of her humor. Knight, making his audio debut, gives the material his best, which is considerable. His familiar image also adds much needed dimension to Martin's flimsy construction.

By improving this ability, he claims, we will learn to better understand and manage ourselves. The first order is to increase our emotional intelligence, comprising personal and social competence. These competencies are our abilities to understand our own feelings, strengths, and weaknesses, and to control our emotions while also understanding the feelings of others and developing skills to form positive relationships with them. Lubit delineates the behaviors of five types of toxic managers--narcissistic, unethical, aggressive, rigid, and impaired--saying that these behaviors are manifestations of depression and fear. By understanding them, we will be able to design strategies to protect ourselves.

The topics covered include establishing clear goals, understanding rationality, personality tests to provide insight into how individuals make decisions, tolerance for risk and its impact on decisions, controlling emotions, the tendency to be overconfident, and ideas for overcoming biases and errors.

{"title": "Gable's Women", "content": " Wayne's biography evokes Gable as a magnetic, virile, outgoing man with many close male friends and many female pursuers. Tracing the actor's life from his birth in 1901 in Cadiz, Ohio, to his death at age 59, the author (Robert Taylor, etc.t describes the women he attracted: his first wife, drama coach Josephine Diller who helped start him in his movie career; later wives and lovers, who included Joan Crawford, (possibly) Loretta Young, Grace Kelly et al. Gable, according to Wayne, dominated women as he dominated the screen in such classics as It Happened One Night and Gone with the Wind, but Carole Lombard, his third wife, was his equal. When she died in a 1941 plane crash, Gable courted suicide as an Air Force officer during World War II. He succumbed to a heart attack in 1960, after costarring with another legend, Marilyn Monroe, in The Misfits. Photos not seen by PW.

{"title": "The Genius of Sitting Bull: Thirteen Heroic Strategies for Today's Business Leaders", "content": " Stretching a simile, this alarmist book about current American economic problems charges that for lack of \"heroic leadership,\" we face a social and economic disaster comparable to that suffered at Little Bighorn in 1876 by Custer against Sioux Chief Sitting Bull. In farfetched allusions to problems overcome by Sitting Bull, the authors urge politicians, CEOs and public services chiefs to emulate the Sioux leader's qualities--commitment, integrity, courage, statesmanship and vision--qualities successfully employed by executives of the few firms cited here. Murphy and Snell propose three phases of action divided into 13 steps: to restore the nation's confidence, to mobilize its resources and to develop Sitting Bull-like leadership. Murphy is a business consultant; Snell is a book developer and literary agent. 40,000 first printing; $50,000 ad/promo; author tour.Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "The Winner's Circle: How Ten Stock Brokers Became the Best in the Business", "content": " The authors believe that current interest in the stock market justifies interviewing ten top producing brokers to determine their techniques, strategies, and career philosophies. While they say that they couldn't find any \"stereotyped personality that lends itself to being a successful stockbroker,\" there are some common traits: tenacity, conscientiousness, commitment, and integrity--qualities probably contributing to success in any field. All the brokers profiled here seem to have had a turning point (a stroke of luck?), after which their careers blossomed. All serve clients who are not making their own decisions, and the authors claim that the average investor can learn from them by comparing their character and moves with those of their own brokers to decide if they are being well served. Perhaps readers who are already stockbrokers can emulate those presented here. For larger business collections due to the limited audience.- Alex Wenner, Indiana Univ.

{"title": "Unlimited Selling Power: How to Master Hypnotic Selling Skills", "content": " The authors of this work believe top salespeople can be developed by applying the principles of hypnosis to sales presentations. They give a brief history of hypnosis and describe how it has been used in the counseling professions. They then show how the same techniques of trust building, wording, voice tone, and delivery can be applied to sales situations. Although this may sound like some shady sales gimmick, it is actually very good advice on the art of persuasion. Less general in approach and more technique-oriented than Kathy Aaronson's Selling on the Fast Track ( LJ 5/15/89), this is recommended for larger libraries or those with large sales collections.- Robert Logsdon, Indiana State Lib., IndianapolisCopyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Germs, Genes, &amp; Civilization: How Epidemics Shaped Who We Are Today (FT Press Science)", "content": " Clark (Molecular Biology Made Simple and Fun) argues that microscopic bacteria, viruses, and fungi have played an enormous and largely unacknowledged role in human history. Beginning with Attila's attack of Rome, which was likely stopped by dysentery, and continuing through modern diseases such as AIDS and the Ebola virus, Clark investigates a large number of illnesses and uncovers the ways in which they have impacted historical events. The same genes that provide humanity with protection against some endemic diseases, Clark argues, may also cause sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. With wit and humor, the author turns death, an ever-heavy topic, into an engrossing exploration of the course of mankind. Though Clark's lack of references will make it difficult for readers to gain additional information, there's much of interest in this chronicle of microbes through the ages.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

June and Jennifer isolate themselves from family and society, sinking into a world of interdependency, fantasy, and obsessive game-playing, until an arson spree lands them in a hospital for the criminally insane. The fascination of this tale lies in the discrepancy between the twins' silent, emotionless facade and the rich creativity and passion that spills out endlessly in their writing. The author has reconstructed their story from their extensive diaries, in which they compulsively explore their lives and the condition of the world as they perceive it. Again and again, they express both their love and hatred for each other and their desire yet inability to become separate individuals. This book is written by a sympathetic journalist for a general audience.Amy D. Goffman, Registered Physical Therapist, Charlottesville, Va.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "How to Land Your First Paralegal Job", "content": " A practical, no-nonsense primer filled with \"hot tips,\" checklists, and sample forms, this book offers a treasure chest of valuable advice on how to join the fast-growing paralegal profession. Differing from most other authors in the field, who concentrate on the knowledge and skills needed by a paralegal, Wagner assumes the reader is qualified for a legal assistant position, although she includes a short chapter on paralegal schools. Her focus is on how to find, interview for, and be hired for that position. Thus, she offers detailed reviews on \"crafting winning resumes,\" writing strong cover letters, employing effective job search strategies, and \"selling yourself\" through the interview process. The list of \"questions to ask the interviewer\" and suggestions for answering difficult or inappropriate questions are especially helpful.

{"title": "Simple Art of Vietnamese Cooking", "content": " This excellent introduction to Vietnamese cooking will provide a good starting place for ignoramuses and a stock of useful recipes for know-it-alls. Duong, owner and chef of Truc Orient Express restaurant in Hartford, Conn., and Kiesel, of Food & Wine magazine, carefully itemize preferred equipment and the many ingredients used in Vietnamese dishes. Recipes appeal not just with their delicate interplay of flavors and textures, but with a golden opportunity to alter one's diet. Vegetables, spices and rice make up the bulk of a meal. And, as with most Asian fare, meats and fish are used to flavor, not to dominate, a dish. Several intriguing Buddhist vegetarian recipes are included. All are well organized, and directions are easily navigated. Some recipes may call for as many as 15 ingredients, so be prepared to spend some time chopping and measuring. Cooking time is quite brief. Because Vietnamese cookery relies on many exotic items--tamarind pulp, starfruit, tiger lily buds, pandan leaves--the authors have thoughtfully provided a mail-order reference source.

{"title": "Tex: The Man Who Built the Dallas Cowboys", "content": " This rambling, discursive biography by Dallas Morning News columnist St. John brings its flamboyant subject to life, but it is vastly overwritten and often difficult to follow. Moving back and forth in time, the book covers Texas E. Schramm's relations with fellow team presidents and owners and with players from Roger Staubach (easy to deal with) to Duane Thomas (impossible to handle). There is much material about the merger between the National Football League and the American Football League as well as about the resolution of the threat posed by the U.S. Football League. Also treated are such innovations as the cheerleading squad (\"not wholesome,\" according to coach Tom Landry); the Dallas Cowboys Weekly , which has a circulation of almost 100,000; and instant replay, of which the author is a strong proponent. Schramm is outspoken and opinionated, so the book is likely to arouse controversy. Photos not seen by PW.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Their most recent collaboration is another response to the public's increasing interest in alternative medicine. Each entry briefly outlines the condition as well as conventional treatments, with the primary focus on drug therapies. The authors then suggest one or more nontraditional approaches to managing the condition, such as nutritional and herbal therapies, homeopathy, relaxation techniques, or lifestyle changes. Introductory chapters include a review of the principle of homeopathic medicine and important guidelines to consider when using homeopathic remedies.

Bastable, assuming the outrage was perpetrated by a Drones Club member, takes his revenge by anonymously publishing a scandalous novel about the misbehavior of the young titled Cocktail Time. Then, afraid that exposure of his authorship will wreck his political aspirations, he lets his worthless nephew, Cosmo, claim the book's authorship?and its royalties. The wicket doesn't get really sticky until Cosmo learns that Hollywood studios are bidding big bucks for Cocktail Time. In the midst of all this, as well as several romances in need of repair, Lord Ickenham is in his element, with happy endings to the deserving and big laughs assured.

In the sequel to her Edgar nominee, The Suspect, Sergeant Karl Alberg of the Mounties is getting nowhere trying to find the killer of an unidentified woman in his small town on the Canadian coast. On the advice of his former lover, Cassandra Mitchell, Alberg asks the high-school art teacher to draw the victim's picture, which leads to her identification. She had been hitchhiking to meet Roger Galbraith, a visiting actor with whom Cassandra is having an affair after jilting Alberg. Galbraith is the prime suspect, but there are others, and the suspense becomes tormenting as the author leads reader through blind alleys and, finally, to an astounding revelation adroitly concealed until the story's close.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"title": "Queer: A Novel", "content": " In an introduction, Burroughs observes that he wrote this heretofore unpublished picaresque novel in 1951, well before Naked Lunch established his reputation. He reveals that the book had its genesis in a terrible event: his accidental shooting to death of his wife, Joan, a tragedy that released the black wellsprings of his talent. The narrative recounts the hallucinatory life of William Lee, an American in Mexico City in the 1940s and his journey to Ecuador with his reluctant lover, Eugene Allerton, in search of the drug Yage. Lee is Burroughs after the killing, weighed down by guilt, drugs, lust and despair; seeking lethe. Admirerers will find an early exposition of Burroughs's later themes here, as well as a strain of gallows humor. The work is almost cinematic as it unfolds; the author is not yet experimenting with the meaninglessness of language, and, indeed it is thin in both thought and expression. This is the first of a series of Burroughs's works to be issued by Viking. Foreign rights: Andrew Wylie Agency.

{"title": "The Jewish People: Their History and Their Religion", "content": " For the overwhelming majority of Jews under Roman rule, Jesus of Nazareth was just one more tragic, fallible victim of the struggle against an oppressive regime. In this scholarly history by two London rabbis of the Progressive branch of Judaism, unfolding events are interpreted as they were felt and lived by the Jewish people. Ever since the French Revolution, when Judaism lost its hold as an all-embracing amalgam of faith and behavior, Jews' responses to the modern world have ranged from conversion or assimilation to fervent nationalism. The narrative, alternately brisk and dry, helps explain how a tiny, persecuted, exiled people maintained a distinctive cultural identity and sense of mission. In extensive sections on ethics, belief, literature and worship, the authors take a refreshingly unconventional approach. Reminding us that \"Old Testament\" is a Christian term alien to Judaism, they reexamine the Jewish Bible's sense of the cosmos as a unitary whole. Their view of Judaism as a set of mitzvoth (commandments), a code of conduct that each believer must rediscover, informs this challenging study.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Holly's \"hold on his fans is to be explained by his very humanity,\" the authors maintain, and, appropriately, they take pains to separate fact from legend. The book concludes with a look at the current \"Holly Renaissance.\" A superb collection of 160 illustrations (photos, maps, clippings, ads, etc.) is spoiled in part because they are reproduced in miniature to fit within the pages' outer margins.

The resulting tale of \"power and manipulation\" is so complex, involving Hollywood, mob and political figures as well as government investigations, that it may try the patience of many readers. Recounting MCA's 62-year rise from Chicago dance-band booking agents into the \"General Motors of Hollywood,\" Moldea (The Hoffa Wars charges that Reagan, while Screen Actors Guild president in the early 1950s, helped create the unprecedented deal that made MCA a powerful force in TV.

{"title": "Fire and Civilization", "content": " Arguing that human control of fire has been a neglected topic in 20th-century social sciences, University of Amsterdam sociologist Goudsblom here surveys the role of fire throughout a vast span of history. Though his style is bland, the author draws on disciplines from anthropology to history and ecology to offer intriguing insights. He begins with the domestication of fire, its impact on agrarianization and its place in ancient Israel, Greece and Rome--where the private fire brigade was instituted. Goudsblom also assesses the significance of fire in culture, suggesting that dread of hell-fire developed as people learned to fear fire in war and in cities. Looking at fire in the industrial age, Goudsblom notes that progress brought the safety match and better fuels as well as greater military destruction and planned, contained forest fires. A final chapter ranges from the psychological analysis of arsonists to the symbolic use of fire in public demonstrations and riots.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

The 11 articles and two interviews (with Edward Said and Harold Bloom) represent a group of prominent writers of the new PC (politically correct) humanities departments, which are (according to the authors) maligned by conservatives such as Dinesh D'Souza ( Illiberal Education , LJ 3/15/91), David Lehman ( Signs of the Times , LJ 3/1/91), and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Instead of discussing the decline of humane learning owing to the advance of multicultural studies, feminism, deconstruction, or other ills, the authors explain that a new humanism is emerging as an international doctrine without boundaries by nations or other groupings. This is an interesting compilation of personal testimonies on a controversial subject. The lead article alone, by Richard Rorty, makes this a worthy addition to humanities collections.- Arla Lindgren, St. John's Univ., New YorkCopyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

Making technical concepts accessible, Davies surveys attempts by Stephen Hawking, Murray Gell-Mann and others to reconcile Einstein's ideas with quantum physics. Among the time-bending phenomena he investigates are black holes, collapsed stars that may abolish time at their centers; kaons, subatomic particles attuned to the expansion of the universe; and antiworlds, hypothetical neighboring regions of space-time in which time flows backward. The author's speculations on causality, God and eternity make this a rewarding tour de force for nonspecialists.

{"title": "Riding with the Lion: In Search of Mystical Christianity", "content": " The journeys of contemporary spiritual seekers are often marked by the search not only for the soul's home but also for a true leader who, like Dante's Virgil, can accompany them on their quest of self-discovery. Markides here provides a kind of spiritual travelogue in which he chronicles his own search for authentic teachers of the sophia perennis. From his study of the Orthodox Christian mystical tradition, the author draws parallels with the spiritual principles enunciated in Hinduism, Buddhism and other Eastern systems of religious expression; he even counsels ways of distinguishing false teachers from true ones. Unfortunately, however, the book is marred by a soupy spirituality whose attempt to synthesize a variety of beliefs and practices into a universal spirituality represents the worst of the New Age. The book will, nonetheless, have wide appeal to those readers seeking the simple integrations of pop spirituality.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"title": "Longing for Darkness: Tara and the Black Madonna", "content": " An alcoholic single mother of three, Texas-born Galland ( Women in the Wilderness ) was raised a strict Roman Catholic, turned to Zen Buddhism, then became obsessed with Tara, the female Buddha of Tibetan tradition, and her counterpart, Kali, the black Hindu goddess, death-dealer and life-giver. In black images of divinity the author sought a touchstone for transformation, an avenue to the unconscious. In a baroque church in Switzerland she observed the Black Madonna, a virgin painted coal-black who holds a black Christ Child in her arms. In India she discussed women lamas with Tibet's Dalai Lama in exile. Her 1987 trip to Poland turned up another Black Madonna but also exposed her to a different kind of darkness: secret police, racism, Auschwitz. Blending travelogue, free-floating meditation, autobiography and adventure, her intensely personal narrative is a disquieting spiritual odyssey.

Japanese Zen master Lin-chi thrashed his pupils. Indian guru Meher Baba remained silent for 43 years. All employed what Feuerstein, author of books on yoga and religion, calls \"holy madness\" or \"crazy wisdom,\" using eccentric behavior or shock tactics to communicate an alternative vision. A former devotee of Da Free John (aka Da Love-Ananda, ne Franklin Jones), Feuerstein presents critical cameos of holy fools (Aleister Crowley, BhagwanRajneesh, etc.) as well as guidelines for choosing a wise, enlightened guru and avoiding the exploitative. Yet his gallery of spiritual eccentrics is so diverse--ranging from Christian mystics to Hindu holy men who live on garbage heaps--that it's hard to credit the author's generalizations about the value of holy folly as an authentic path to transcendence.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition."}
{"title": "Zen and Us", "content": " Initially, this attempt to explain why Westerners should consider Zen suffers from its heavy-handed attack on Christianity, seen as a monolithic ritual rather than as the potpourri it is.

In the second half, however, when the narrator becomes we, I, or Zen, the book begins to sing, and one gets the flavor of Zen itself. The explanations of Zen practices are clear, showing not only how, but why, things are done as they are. The author offers examples from the literature as well as from his own experience.

De Bono ( I Am Right You Are Wrong ) takes a no-nonsense approach, pointing out that much thinking is inefficient and that many highly intelligent people are not good thinkers.

{"title": "A Fish in the Water: A Memoir", "content": " In a dramatic, ebullient memoir, eminent Peruvian novelist Vargas Llosa recounts his unsuccessful bid for the Peruvian presidency in 1990 on a reformist platform. Believing private enterprise to be the driving force of economic development, Vargas Llosa, who promised to end state control of the economy, discrimination and entrenched class privilege in Peru's multiracial society, rejects the oft-repeated thesis that Alberto Fujimori, who won the election, has appropriated his ideas. On the contrary, he criticizes Fujimori's regime as authoritarian and destined to propagate backwardness.

{"title": "Sharpe's Sword", "content": " This powerful, exciting novel, the fourth in Cornwell's fine series on the Napoleonic Wars (e.g., Sharpe's Honour, Audio Reviews, LJ 5/15/95), focuses on a key turning point: Wellington's defeat of the French in the Battle of Salamanca. Sharpe, who embodies the heroism of the common soldier, dies a dozen deaths in his struggle against Colonel Leroux, the man responsible for killing Britain's top spies. Sharpe falls into the beguiling Marquesa's web, blissfully unaware that the actions of this passionate beauty will determine victor and vanquished. The author details military strategy, pits infantry against cavalry, and shows how class considerations impact the entire conduct of the war, including medical treatment of wounded officers and low-born soldiers. A valuable epilog reveals how closely the recording captures the historic individuals and locations.

Concerned with what makes people want to succeed, Deci conducted extensive studies demonstrating that when subjects are encouraged to pursue a task for its own sake, they do it better and enjoy it more than those told to do it for a reward or informed that they will be punished if they don't do it correctly. These results lead to his conclusion?amply illustrated through anecdotal and scholarly evidence?that authoritarian motivational strategies such as the reward/punishment systems commonly used in American schools and businesses alienate people from their work, make them less productive and leave them less fulfilled.

{"title": "I Don't Have to Make Everything All Better", "content": " Based on Gary Lundberg's work in family and relationship counseling, this revised version of a self-published work wisely maintains the deliberately simple narrative voice of the original. The authors call for \"validation,\" a powerful technique for improving one-on-one communication that involves careful, empathetic listening to another person's feelings without judging, criticizing or attempting to solve his or her problems. The authors demonstrate this technique's startling effectiveness in a variety of situations and provide readers with valuable coaching and specific responses, cautioning that authentic validation is grounded in respect and honesty, or else it might be seen as manipulation. The Lundbergs include many recognizable examples from their workshop practice and from their experience as parents of five. Some sample situations may be resolved a bit too easily for some tastes, but even the most jaded reader is bound to learn from the material, which holds special appeal for parents of young children. Anyone who has been confronted with a spouse or a child who had a bad day, a cranky customer, colleague or demanding relative stands to benefit from the Lundbergs' advice.

Wills, author of Nixon Agonistes and Inventing America, portrays a Reagan whose optimistic personality is in harmony with the deep instincts of Americans. The President, he maintains, embodies the country's values and its collective dreams and memories. In his show-business years, Reagan was \"the voice of midwestern baseball\" and \"the plain-spoken hero of horse epics\"; later, as Hollywood union leader and California governor, he was the complete \"company man.\" As President, his simple answers in the face of troubling complexities have let Americans feel positive about themselves.

Through her use of primary-source materials such as letters and diaries, the author personalizes this history without whitewashing it. She also captures the prejudice faced by those women with nerve enough to assist in the war effort in a more public way, especially their poor treatment by men. In one of the most vivid passages, she describes Sojourner Truth facing down an audience of hostile men and bringing them to their feet cheering. The black-and-white archival photographs and reproductions are excellent, some showing how women continued to be portrayed as ``delicate and demure'' even though their work required determination and energy.

For despite Smollett's importance, most of his writings, including this title, are out of print in both the United States and Britain.

{"title": "Cemetery Nights (Poets, Penguin)", "content": " Line breaks notwithstanding, Dobyns's sixth volume of poetryhe is also author of the praised Saratoga series of detective novelshas the structure of a self-contained collection of prose poems. Not strictly linked, they comprise a mythology of Dobyn's own creation. Some recurrent characters include: the dead, angels and devils of questionable competence, God and a variety of faceless creatures meant to designate Everyman. The poet and his family put in appearances in several parable-like stories, and Dobyns reworks myths in stories about Midas, Orpheus, Odysseus and Theseus. Throughout his work, there is a disturbing amount of pessimism. The extent of random evil in his universe outdoes even the dourest of existential philosophers. Yet such is the power of Dobyns's conviction and his art that these poems have enormous staying power, challenging the reader to refute, if pos-sible, their nightmare vision.Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Fatal Inversion", "content": " A Dark-Adapted Eyefirst novel under the pseudonym Barbara Vine by the British author Ruth Rendellwon the MBA Edgar. This is the second, a mystery like all her works, transcending the genre. Evoked in beautifully ambient writing, the setting is a rural estate, Wyvis Hall, which Adam Verne-Smith inherits at age 19. Inverting the word \"someplace,\" Adam names his eden Ecalpemos where he revels through a summer with four companions. The months drift by until a horrible event scatters the lotus eaters, and Adam sells the property. For 10 years, the former friends live secure in the belief that they alone know their terrible secret. Then the present owners of Wyvis Hall dig a grave for their dog in the pet cemetery on the grounds and unearth human remains. Making headlines, the news stuns the Ecalpemos conspirators, long since established as proper London citizens. The author virtually defies one to pause between incidents in the exquisitely controlled developments that peak in a marvel of irony that no reader could foresee.Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"title": "The Riddle of the Sands", "content": " An insightful introduction by the author's great-grandson distinguishes this reissue of a seminal work of spy fiction first published in 1903. At the dawn of the 20th century, Carruthers, a young Foreign Office functionary, is lamenting being stuck in London with little to do when he receives a surprising communiqu&eacute; from Oxford classmate Arthur Davies. Davies's request to join him on a yacht in Schleswig-Holstein includes an eccentric laundry-list of items that Davies wants his friend to bring. With nothing else on his horizon, Carruthers accepts, and ends up enmeshed in intrigue centering on Davies's concern that Germany's growing sea-power poses a threat to England. Childers (1870-1922) couples his patiently developed plot with richly imagined lead characters. Davies himself is the standout, rounded out by numerous quirks, including a craving for throwing items overboard from his small vessel. Eric Ambler fans will find this a fascinating antecedent.(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.  All rights reserved.--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition."}

{"title": "Pnin (Penguin Modern Classics)", "content": " Nabokov fans will be disappointed by narrator Stefan Rudnicki's stiff, staid performance in this audio version of the author's 13th novel. Told in a series of vignettes, the story follows Russian immigrant and professor Timofey Pavlovich Pnin as he boards the wrong train on his way to deliver a lecture, loses his luggage, struggles with the English language, hunts for living quarters, deals with his ex-wife, and throws a faculty party. Rudnicki's narration is clear and steady, but fails to capture the playfulness of Nabokov's prose and the humor of the text. Instead, Rudnicki's tone is variously stiff, needlessly booming, or monotone. He does, however, provide a wide range of voices for the cast of characters. His rendition of the title character-which sounds like a hybrid of Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat and Soviet comedian Yakov Smirnoff-is dynamic and entertaining. Listeners will be left wishing Rudnicki had infused more of his narration with those qualities. (Nov.)(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.  All rights reserved.--This text refers to theAudio CDedition."}
{"title": "Eagle Song (Puffin Chapters)", "content": " It's a shock for fourth-grader Danny Bigtree to move to Brooklyn from his Mohawk Nation reservation: suddenly he has no friends, and his classmates taunt him, asking him where his war pony is and telling him to go home to his teepee. After his charismatic father makes a class visit to talk about Iroquois culture, his peers begin to warm up to him. Bruchac, author of numerous books with Native American themes, weaves into the story the legend of the great peacemaker Aionwahta, who united five warring Indian nations into the Iroquois Confederacy and turned an enemy into an ally. Can Danny be, like Aionwahta, an agent of peace, and find a way to transform the school bully into a friend? This appealing portrayal of a strong family offers an unromanticized view of Native American culture, and a history lesson about the Iroquois Confederacy; it also gives a subtle lesson in the meaning of daily courage.

{"title": "Women in Love (Penguin Classics)", "content": " The published editions of Women in Love , probably Lawrence's greatest novel, have always been remarkably corrupt due to a lengthy, complex process of revision and transcription, a threatened libel suit, and numerous unauthorized bowdlerizations. The editors of this new Cambridge Edition have labored scrupulously to produce an authoritative text. What emerges, if not dramatically different, is fresher and more immediate. The introduction provides a valuable history of the novel's composition, revision, publication, and reception, and though the elaborate textual apparatus is strictly for advanced students of bibliography, the notes are splendid.

{"title": "The Penguin Atlas of Food: Who Eats What, Where, and Why", "content": " By means of colored maps, bar graphs, pie charts, and data tables, Millstone and Lang make comprehensible a wealth of complex statistical data on where the food we eat comes from, who eats what, who produces it, and what that means for nutrition, the environment, and economics. In full-color graphics, the authors show how nations compare with one another on such diverse topics as disease, over- and under-nutrition, animal feeds, pesticide use, trade flows, staple foods, fast food, alcohol consumption, and advertising. The authors clearly intend to demonstrate the results that globalization and technological advance have wrought. Graphs on food aid clearly show that despite its huge aid outlay, the U.S. actually contributes through governmental channels comparatively little of its wealth. Supplementing the graphs, a massive table lays out precise numbers from which the graphs were generated, and a bibliography provides guidance through the source documentation. Most all data cover the years 1999-2001. This is a significant and valuable guide to worldwide food-related statistics.Mark KnoblauchCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

{"title": "The Barracks", "content": " Celebrated Irish author McGahern has written six novels, most recentlyBy the Lake(2002) and four short story collections. This is the first U.S. publication of his first novel, which was written in 1963. It is the story of Elizabeth Reegan, who, after years of being alone, marries a widower with three children. Her husband, a policeman, is a hard and bitter man who never passes up the opportunity to stick it to his rule-mongering boss. Endless chores and her deep awareness of her inability to soothe her husband's restlessness or to be an essential part of her stepchildren's lives have left Elizabeth dispirited. When she learns that she has breast cancer, her feelings about the futility of her life deepen, but she also sees the value in trying to meet her fate with dignity. Shot through with fatalism and told in reserved and beautiful prose, this authoritative novel conveys both the bleakness of the Irish civil servant's lot in the 1960s and the courage needed to face down frustration and despair.Joanne WilkinsonCopyright &#169; American Library Association.
